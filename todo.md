# TODO

- Calculate traveled length of the Snake (Sum over the distance between the pos_data of 10 steps)
- Different reward function
- Try the following hyperparameters:
  - DVS Parameters
  - Cropped resolution
  - w0_min
  - w0_max
  - reward_factor
- Change 'from parameters import \*' to 'import parameters as params'
- New maze form so that the snake makes a right and a left circle in on direction and a left and then a right circle in the other; the testing case is to travel the whole maze
- End training if snaked managed to reach starting area again in both directions two times
- Plot positive and negative direction steps seperately
- Code rework + comments

# Questions
- Turning model
