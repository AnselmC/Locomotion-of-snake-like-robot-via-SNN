# TODO

- Calculate traveled length of the Snake (Sum over the distance between the pos_data of 10 steps)
- Try the following hyperparameters:
  - DVS Parameters
  - Cropped resolution
  - w0_min
  - w0_max
  - reward_factor
  - w_min
  - w_max
- Code rework + comments
  - Change 'from parameters import \*' to 'import parameters as params'
- Decaying reward_factor
- Plot steps in negative and positive direction

# Questions
- Turning model

Meeting on 07/20/2018
- Title: Don't mention DVS
- Background
  - Theoretical Background
  - Related Network: more latest research
- Plot graphs by yourself
- Make Snake picture more elegant
- Make flowchart text bigger
- 3 scenarios:
- Theory contribution: Hidden layer with reward backpropagation
