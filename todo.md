# TODO

  - session_015: test best of the above with different texture

- Testing scenario
  - Different heights in same scenario
- Code rework + comments
  - Snake Lua script remove comments
  - Remove debug comments
  - Clean Repository
- Add training length in VREP
- In Latex
  - New thesis title
  - Write Abstract
  - List of Figures: show only titles
  - Write Introduction
  - Remove RL chapter
  - Plot LIF Figure (Figure 2.4)
  - Plot eligibility trace Figure (Figure 2.5)
  - Plot weight update Figure (Figure 2.6)
  - Combine Theoretical Background and Literature Review
  - Add nicer picture of the snake (Figure 4.1)
  - Renew DVS frame (Figure 4.3)
  - Add maze picture (Section 4.1.3)
  - Revise controller flowchart (Figure 4.5):
    - Bigger text
    - Run instead of simulate function
  - Own network architecture figure (Figure 4.6)
  - Own reward figure (Figure 4.7)
  - Use network.run() function in Figure 4.8a
  - Revise step function flowchart (Figure 4.8b)
    - Bigger text
    - Check if it is correct
  - Add training flowchart
  - Write section 5.3 Testing
  - Write Conclusion and Outlook
  - Appendix
    - Simulation parameters table (Ref at Table 5.1)
    - Plots for the 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 controller (Ref at Section 5.2.2)

# Questions
