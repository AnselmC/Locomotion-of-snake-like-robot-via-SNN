# TODO

- Calculate traveled length of the Snake (Sum over the distance between the pos_data of 10 steps)
- Try the following hyperparameters:
  - DVS Parameters
  - Cropped resolution
  - w0_min
  - w0_max
  - reward_factor
- New maze form so that the snake makes a right and a left circle in on direction and a left and then a right circle in the other; the testing case is to travel the whole maze
- Code rework + comments
  - Change 'from parameters import \*' to 'import parameters as params'
  - Snake Lua script
- Decaying reward_factor
- Mark episodes on weights change over time plot

# Questions
- Turning model
- Feedback Hidden layer idea
- Snake falls through floor
- What metrics to plot in discussion
- getState function Claus
- max_spikes calculation
- Timing analysis, VREP and SNN out of syn

- Background
  - Theoretical Background
  - Related Network: more latest research
- Plot graphs by yourself
- Make Snake picture more elegant
- Make flowchart text bigger
- 3 scenarios:
- Theory contribution: Hidden layer with reward backpropagation
