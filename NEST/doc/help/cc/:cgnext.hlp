Name: :cgnext - Call next() on a ConnectionGenerator

Synopsis:

cg :cgnext -> source target v[0] ... true | false


Description:

Call the next() function on a given ConnectionGenerator cg 
to iterate cg's connections on the SLI level. This function 
will return the source and the target of the connection, the 
values for the connection (if there are any), and true, or 
false, if cg cannot be iterated further.


Parameters:

cg	- ConnectionGenerator


Remarks:

This function is part of the low-level access API for the 
ConnectionGenerator module. It is mainly used for debugging 
purposes. Usually, connections are created from a 
ConnectionGenerator using CGConnect.


Availability:

Only if compiled with libneurosim support
