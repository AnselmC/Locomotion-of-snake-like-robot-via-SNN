Name: Set - Define an association between a name and an object in the current 
 dictionary

Synopsis:

obj literal   Set ->	- 
[... [obj_1 ...] ... obj_n] [... [literal_1 ...] ... literal_n] Set ->	-


Examples:

{1 2 add} /myproc Set 
[4 3] [/x /y] Set 
[[4 3 7] [-9 1]] [[/a /b /c] [/x /y]] Set 
[[4 9] 3] [/x /y] Set 
[[4 9] 3] [[/a /b] /y] Set


Description:

In the first form Set is identical to def, except for the reversed parameters 
and creates or modifies an entry for the literal in the current dictionary. The 
new value assigned to the literal is obj. 
In the second form multiple simultaneous assignments are made to the literals 
contained in the second. The nesting of this array is arbitrary, indicated in 
the synopsis by the inner brackets, and the same object are taken from the 
identical positions in first array.
