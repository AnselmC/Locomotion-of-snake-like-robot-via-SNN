Name: currentname - returns the most recently resolved name

Synopsis:

currentname -> name true 
-> false


Description:

currentname returns the most recently resolved name whose contents 
is still under execution. 
currentname is useful for error handling purposes where a procedure 
has to know the name with which it has been called. 
Example: 
/divide 
{ 
0 eq 
{ 
currentname /DivisionByZero raiseerror 
} if 
div 
} def 
Note: 
This function is not foolproof, as it will fail for bound procedures. 
currentname evaluates certain debugging information on the execution 
stack. Note that the SLI interpreter can be compiled not to generate 
this information. In this case currentname fails, i.e. it will always 
return false
