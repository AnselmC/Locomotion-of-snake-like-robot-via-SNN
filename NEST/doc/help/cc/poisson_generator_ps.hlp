Name: poisson_generator_ps - simulate neuron firing with Poisson processes 
 (with arbitrary dead time) statistics and exact timing

Description:

The poisson_generator_ps generator simulates a neuron firing with Poisson 
statistics (with dead time), ie, exponentially distributed interspike 
intervals plus constant dead time, spike events have exact timing 
(i.e. not binned).


Parameters:

The following parameters appear in the element's status dictionary: 
rate		- mean firing rate. (double, var) 
dead_time	- minimal time between two spikes. (double, var)


Sends:

SpikeEvent


Remarks:

- This generator must be connected to all its targets using the 
same synapse model. Failure to do so will only be detected at 
runtime. 
	- This generator has only been validated in a very basic manner.
