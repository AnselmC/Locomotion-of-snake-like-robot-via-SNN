Name: abort - Abort all NEST processes gracefully. 
 Paramteres: 
 exitcode - The exitcode to quit with

Description:

This function can be run by the user to end all NEST processes as 
gracefully as possible. If NEST is compiled without MPI support, 
this will just call quit_i. If compiled with MPI support, it will 
call MPI_Abort, which will kill all processes of the application 
and thus prevents deadlocks. The exitcode is userabort in both 
cases (see statusdict/exitcodes).
