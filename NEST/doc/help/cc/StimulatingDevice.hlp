Name: StimulatingDevice - General properties of stimulating devices.

Description:

Stimulating devices inject signals into a network, either as analog signals 
such a currents or as spike trains. Most stimulating devices are implemented 
so that they are replicated on each virtual process. Many, but not all 
devices generating noise or stochastic spike trains provide different signals 
to each of their recipients; see the documentation of the individual device. 
Stimulating devices share the start, stop, and origin parameters global to 
devices. Start and stop have the following meaning for stimulating devices 
(origin is just a global offset): 
	- For spike-emitting devices, only spikes with times t that fulfill 
start < t <= stop 
are emitted. Note that spikes that have time t==start are NOT emitted. 
	- For current-emitting devices, the current is activated and deactivated such 
that the current first affects the target dynamics during the update step 
(start, start+h], i.e., an effect can be recorded at the earliest at time 
start+h. The last interval during which the current affects the target's 
dynamics is (stop-h, stop].


Parameters:

/start 	- Actication time, relative to origin. 
/stop  	- Inactivation time, relative to origin. 
/origin	- Reference time for start and stop.
