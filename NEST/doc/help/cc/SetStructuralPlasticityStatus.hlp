Name: SetStructuralPlasticityStatus - Set up parameters for structural 
 plasticity.

Synopsis:

Structural plasticity allows the user to treat the nodes as neurons with 
synaptic elements, allowing new synapses to be created and existing synapses 
to be deleted during the simulation according to a set of growth and 
homeostatic rules. This function allows the user to set up various 
parameters for structural plasticity.


Parameters:
