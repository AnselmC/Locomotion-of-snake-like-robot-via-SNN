Name: music_cont_out_proxy - A device which sends continuous data from NEST to 
 MUSIC.

Description:

A music_cont_out_proxy can be used to send continuous data from 
neurons over MUSIC to remote applications. It works in a similar fashion like 
the multimeter model. The user has to specify the recordable values to observe 
(e.g. ["V_m"]) via the record_from parameter. The target neurons are specified 
by a list of global neuron ids which must be passed via the "targets" 
parameter. The music_cont_out_proxy will be connected automatically to the 
specified target neurons. It is not possible to apply further changes to the 
list of target neurons or observed quantities once the simulation has been 
started for the first time. 
In case of multiple recordables the data can be read out (PyNEST only) of the 
receiving buffer via the following access pattern: 
buffer[ target_gid_index ][ recordable_index] = buffer[ target_gid_index * 
record_from.size() + recordable_index ] 
For example:  target_gids = [ 2, 5, 4 ], record_from = ["V_m"] and 
we want to get "V_m" for neuron with GID 5: buffer[ 1*1 + 0 ]


Parameters:

The following properties are available in the status dictionary: 
interval	 double  	- Recording interval in milliseconds 
targets	 array  	- Global id list of neurons to be observed 
port_name   string  	- The name of the MUSIC output port to send to 
(default: cont_out) 
port_width   integer 	- The width of the MUSIC input port 
published   bool		- A bool indicating if the port has been already 
published with MUSIC. Read only property. 
record_from  array  	- Array containing the names of variables to record 
from, obtained from the /recordables entry of the 
model from which one wants to record


Require:

HAVE_MUSIC


Availability:

Only when compiled with MPI and MUSIC
