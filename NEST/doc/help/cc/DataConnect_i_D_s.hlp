Name: DataConnect_i_D_s - Connect many neurons from data.

Synopsis:

gid dict model  DataConnect_i_D_s ->	- 
gid  	- GID of the source neuron 
dict  	- dictionary with connection parameters 
model 	- the synapse model as string or literal


Description:

Connects the source neuron to targets according to the data in dict, using 
the synapse 'model'. 
Dict is a parameter dictionary that must contain the connection parameters as 
DoubleVectors. 
The parameter dictionary must contain at least the fields: 
/target <. gid_1 ... gid_n .> 
/weight <. w1_1 ... w_n .> 
/delay  <. d_1 ... d_n .> 
All of these must be DoubleVectors of the same length. 
Depending on the synapse model, the dictionary may contain other keys, again 
as DoubleVectors of the same length as /target. 
DataConnect will iterate all vectors and create the connections according to 
the parameters given.
