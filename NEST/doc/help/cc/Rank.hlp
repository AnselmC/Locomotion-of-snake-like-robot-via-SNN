Name: Rank - Return the MPI rank of the process.

Synopsis:

Rank -> int


Description:

Returns the rank of the MPI process (MPI_Comm_rank) executing the 
command. This function is mainly meant for logging and debugging 
purposes. It is highly discouraged to use this function to write 
rank-dependent code in a simulation script as this can break NEST 
in funny ways, of which dead-locks are the nicest.
