Name: rdevdict::*_clipped - clipped random deviate generators.

Description:

Generate random numbers from an underlying distribution, 
but restricted to a certain interval. 
For continuous distributions, 
low < random < high 
will hold true, i.e., numbers are restricted to the open interval (low, high). 
If the distribution itself is restricted to, e.g., positiv numbers, setting 
low < 0 will still only return positive numbers. Clipping only excludes numbers 
outside (low, high). 
For discrete distribtions, numbers are limited to {low, low+1, ... high}, i.e., 
in this case min and max are included. 
Numbers are clipped by re-drawing any number outside (low, high), until 
a number in (log, high) is drawn. The actual distribution of random 
numbers drawn will be a distorted version of the underlying 
distribution.


Parameters:

/low  lower bound (default: -inf) 
/high upper bound (default: +inf)


Remarks:

- Clipped generators can be very inefficient if there is little probability 
mass in (low, high). 
	- For continuous distributions, the probability of actually drawing 
min or max is approximately 2^-62   2e-19, i.e., negligible. Therefore, 
one can only clip to open intervals. 
	- There are also *_clipped_to_boundary versions of the generators. These 
return the respective boundary value if a value outside the interval is 
drawn. These versions are mainly provided to allow reproduction of 
publications that used this strategy.
