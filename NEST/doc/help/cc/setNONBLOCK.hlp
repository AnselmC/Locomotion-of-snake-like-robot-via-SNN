Name: setNONBLOCK - Switch between blocking and non-blocking I/O.

Synopsis:

ifstream {true|false} setNONBLOCK -> ifstream


Examples:

cin   false setNONBLOCK 
myfifo true  setNONBLOCK % set non-blocking I/O for my fifo.


Description:

"setNONBLOCK" sets or erases the O_NONBLOCK flag on 
an input stream. The O_NONBLOCK flag determines, if 
a read attempt will block when no data is currently 
available from the stream. By default, a newly 
created stream has the O_NONBLOCK-Flag erased, 
meaning that blocking I/O is selected. By erasing 
O_NONBLOCK, a subsequent read attempt on the stream 
will yield EOF if no data is available. 
Alternatives: Function setNONBLOCK_is_b (undocumented) 
-> behavior and synopsis are the same.


Parameters:

In : ifstream: The stream to change the flag on. 
Out:	-

Diagnostics:

If a system-error occurs, a code is stored in "sys_errno" 
(contained in errordict) to identify the error, and "sys_errname" 
is set to the error message. Then a "SystemError" is raised. 
The following system errors may be issued, according to the 
POSIX standard (errors in parentheses are not 
expected to occur in this routines' context): 
(EACCES)  Search permission is denied for a 
directory in a files path prefix. 
(EAGAIN)  The ON_NONBLOCK flag is set for a file 
descriptor and the process would be 
delayed in the I/O operation. 
EBADF   Invalid file descriptor. (With the current 
implementation, this indicates trouble 
getting a filedescriptor from a stream. If 
it occurs, ask the author for a proper 
solution!) 
(EDEADLK) An fcntl with function F_SETLKW would 
cause a deadlock. 
EINTR   Function was interrupted by a signal. 
(EINVAL)  Invalid argument. 
(EMFILE   Too many file descriptors are in use by 
this process. 
(ENOLCK)  No locks available.
