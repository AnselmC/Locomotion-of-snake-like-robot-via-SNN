Name: GetVpRNG - return random number generator associated to virtual process 
 of node

Synopsis:

gid GetVpRNG -> rngtype


Description:

This function is helpful in the implementation of parallelized wiring 
routines that create identical random structures independent of the 
number of machines and threads participating in the simulation. The 
function is used in SLI libraries. There is probably no need to 
directly use GetVpRNG in scripts describing a particular simulation. 
In NEST each node (e.g. neuron) is assigned to a virtual process and 
each virtual process maintains its own random number generator. In a 
simulation run the virtual processes are equally distributed over the 
participating machines and threads as specified by the user. In NEST 
2.0 virtual processes are identified with threads.  Thus, with the 
option /total_num_virtual_procs of [0] set to n, there are in total 
always n threads (virtual processes) independent of the number of 
participating machines.  The concept of virtual processes is described 
in detail in [1]. 
Identical results are achieved independent of the number of machines 
and threads participating in a simulation if all operations modifying 
a neuron and its incoming synapses use the random number generator of 
the virtual process the neuron is assigned to. 
An ArgumentTypeError is raised if GetVpRNG is called for a 
non-local gid.


Parameters:

gid 	- global id of the node
