Name: pgetrusage - Get resource consumption information 
 Synopsis:  pgetrusage - selfinfo childinfo

Description:

Calls the POSIX getrusage() function to obtain information on 
memory consumption, context switches, I/O operatin count, etc, 
for both the main process and its children.  Information is 
returned in dictionaries.


Remarks:

At least under Linux, child processes return 0 for all 
entries, while the main process seems to produce meaningfull data 
only for minflt and majflt, i.e., page reclaims and faults.
