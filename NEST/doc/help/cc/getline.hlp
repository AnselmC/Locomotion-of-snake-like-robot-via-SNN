Name: getline - Read a newline terminated string from an input stream.

Synopsis:

istreamhandle getline -> istreamhandle string true 
-> istreamhandle false


Description:

getline reads a line from the supplied stream. 
If the read process was successful, a result string and 
the boolean true are returned. 
If an error occured while reading from the stream, only the 
stream and boolean false is returned.


Diagnostics:

No errors are raised. If getline is applied to an 
invalid stream, the return value is false. The return value 
false indicates that the state of the stream is no longer 
"good".
