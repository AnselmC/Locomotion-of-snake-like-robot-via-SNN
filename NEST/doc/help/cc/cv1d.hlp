Name: cv1d - convert 2-dimensional coordinates to 1-dim index

Synopsis:

y   x   w  cv1d -> i


Description:

This function converts a 2-dimensional matrix address to 
the corresponding index of a linear array.  Useful if you have to handle 
2-dimensional data (e.g. an image) which is stored in a linear array. 
Note that by convention the origin is 0,0 and at the upper left corner.


Parameters:

y : integer. the y-coordinate 
x : integer. the x coordinate 
w : integer. the border with of the 2-dimensional coordinate system 
Example: 3 2 4 cv1d -> 14 
3 is the y-coordinate (row) 
2 is the x coordinate (column) 
4 is the number of columns 
14 is the index of the corresponding element in a 1-dimensional array
