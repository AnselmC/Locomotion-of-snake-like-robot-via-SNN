Name: kernel - Global properties of the simulation kernel.

Description:

Global properties of the simulation kernel.


Parameters:

The following parameters are available in the kernel status dictionary. 
Time and resolution 
resolution	 doubletype 	- The resolution of the simulation (in ms) 
time	 doubletype 	- The current simulation time 
to_do	 integertype	- The number of steps yet to be simulated (read only) 
max_delay	 doubletype 	- The maximum delay in the network 
min_delay	 doubletype 	- The minimum delay in the network 
ms_per_tic	 doubletype 	- The number of milliseconds per tic 
tics_per_ms	 doubletype 	- The number of tics per millisecond 
tics_per_step	 integertype	- The number of tics per simulation time step 
T_max	 doubletype 	- The largest representable time value (read only) 
T_min	 doubletype 	- The smallest representable time value (read only) 
Parallel processing 
total_num_virtual_procs  integertype	- The total number of virtual processes 
local_num_threads	 integertype	- The local number of threads 
num_processes	 integertype	- The number of MPI processes (read only) 
num_rec_processes	 integertype	- The number of MPI processes reserved for recording spikes 
num_sim_processes	 integertype	- The number of MPI processes reserved for simulating neurons 
off_grid_spiking	 booltype  	- Whether to transmit precise spike times in MPI 
communication (read only) 
Random number generators 
grng_seed	 integertype	- Seed for global random number generator used 
synchronously by all virtual processes to 
create, e.g., fixed fan-out connections 
(write only). 
rng_seeds	 arraytype  	- Seeds for the per-virtual-process random 
number generators used for most purposes. 
Array with one integer per virtual process, 
all must be unique and differ from 
grng_seed (write only). 
Output 
data_path	 stringtype 	- A path, where all data is written to 
(default is the current directory) 
data_prefix	 stringtype 	- A common prefix for all data files 
overwrite_files	 booltype  	- Whether to overwrite existing data files 
print_time	 booltype  	- Whether to print progress information during the simulation 
Network information 
network_size	 integertype	- The number of nodes in the network (read only) 
num_connections	 integertype	- The number of connections in the network 
(read only, local only) 
Waveform relaxation method (wfr) 
use_wfr	 booltype  	- Whether to use waveform relaxation method 
wfr_comm_interval	 doubletype 	- Desired waveform relaxation communication interval 
wfr_tol	 doubletype 	- Convergence tolerance of waveform relaxation method 
wfr_max_iterations	 integertype	- Maximal number of iterations used for waveform relaxation 
wfr_interpolation_order  integertype	- Interpolation order of polynomial used in wfr iterations 
Miscellaneous 
dict_miss_is_error	 booltype  	- Whether missed dictionary entries are treated as errors
