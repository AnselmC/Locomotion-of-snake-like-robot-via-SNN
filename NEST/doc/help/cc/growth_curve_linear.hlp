Name: growth_curve_linear - Linear version of a growth curve

Description:

This class represents a linear growth rule for the number of synaptic 
elements inside a neuron. The creation and deletion of synaptic elements 
when structural plasticity is enabled, allows the dynamic rewiring of the 
network during the simulation. 
This type of growth curve uses an exact integration method to update the 
number of synaptic elements: dz/dt = nu (1	- (1/eps) * Ca(t)), where nu is 
the growth rate [elements/ms] and eps is the desired average calcium 
concentration. The growth rate nu is defined in the SynapticElement class.


Parameters:

eps	 double	-  The target calcium concentration that 
the neuron should look to achieve by creating or 
deleting synaptic elements. It should always be a 
positive value.  It is important to note that the 
calcium concentration is linearly proportional to the 
firing rate. This is because dCa/dt =	- Ca(t)/tau_Ca 
+ beta_Ca if the neuron fires and dCa/dt =	- 
Ca(t)/tau_Ca otherwise, where tau_Ca is the calcium 
concentration decay constant and beta_Ca is the 
calcium intake constant (see SynapticElement class). 
This means that eps also defines the desired firing 
rate that the neuron should achieve.  For example, an 
eps = 0.05 [Ca2+] with tau_Ca = 10000.0 and beta_Ca = 
0.001 for a synaptic element means a desired firing 
rate of 5Hz.
