Name: ppd_sup_generator - simulate the superimposed spike train of a population 
 of Poisson processes 
 with dead time.

Description:

The ppd_sup_generator generator simulates the pooled spike train of a 
population of neurons firing independently with Poisson process with dead 
time statistics. 
The rate parameter can also be sine-modulated. The generator does not 
initialize to equilibrium in this case, initial transients might occur.


Parameters:

The following parameters appear in the element's status dictionary: 
rate	 double	- mean firing rate of the component processes, 
default: 0 s^-1 
dead_time	 double	- minimal time between two spikes of the component 
processes, default: 0 ms 
n_proc	 long  	- number of superimposed independent component 
processes, default: 1 
frequency	 double	- rate modulation frequency, default: 0 Hz 
relative_amplitude  double	- relative rate modulation amplitude, default: 0


Remarks:

The generator has been published in Deger, Helias, Boucsein, Rotter (2011)
