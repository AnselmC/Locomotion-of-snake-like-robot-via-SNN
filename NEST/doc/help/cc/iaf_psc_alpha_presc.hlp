Name: iaf_psc_alpha_presc - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron 
 with alpha-shape postsynaptic currents; prescient implementation.

Description:

iaf_psc_alpha_presc is the "prescient" implementation of the leaky 
integrate-and-fire model neuron with alpha-shaped postsynaptic 
currents in the sense of [1]. 
PSCs are normalized to an amplitude of 1pA. 
The prescient implementation predicts the effect of spikes arriving 
during a time step by exactly integrating their effect from the 
precise time of spike arrival to the end of the time step.  This is 
exact if the neuron was not refractory at the beginning of the 
interval and remains subthreshold throughout the 
interval. Subthreshold dynamics are integrated using exact integration 
between events [2].


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary. 
V_m	 double	- Membrane potential in mV 
E_L	 double	- Resting membrane potential in mV. 
V_min	 double	- Absolute lower value for the membrane potential. 
C_m	 double	- Capacity of the membrane in pF 
tau_m	 double	- Membrane time constant in ms. 
t_ref	 double	- Duration of refractory period in ms. 
V_th	 double	- Spike threshold in mV. 
V_reset	 double	- Reset potential of the membrane in mV. 
tau_syn	 double	- Rise time of the synaptic alpha function in ms. 
I_e	 double	- Constant external input current in pA. 
Interpol_Order  int	- Interpolation order for spike time: 
0-none, 1-linear, 2-quadratic, 3-cubic


Receives:

SpikeEvent, CurrentEvent, DataLoggingRequest


Sends:

SpikeEvent


Remarks:

If tau_m is very close to tau_syn_ex or tau_syn_in, the model 
will numerically behave as if tau_m is equal to tau_syn_ex or 
tau_syn_in, respectively, to avoid numerical instabilities. 
For details, please see IAF_Neruons_Singularity.ipynb in 
the NEST source code (docs/model_details).
