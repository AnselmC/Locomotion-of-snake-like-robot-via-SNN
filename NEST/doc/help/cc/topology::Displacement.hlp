Name: topology::Displacement - compute displacement vector

Synopsis:

from_gid to_gid Displacement -> [double vector] 
from_pos to_gid Displacement -> [double vector]


Description:

This function returns a vector connecting the position of the "from_gid" 
node or the explicitly given "from_pos" position and the position of the 
"to_gid" node. Nodes must be parts of topology layers. 
The "from" position is projected into the layer of the "to_gid" node. If 
this layer has periodic boundary conditions (EdgeWrap is true), then the 
shortest displacement vector is returned, taking into account the 
periodicity. Fixed grid layers are in this case extended so that the 
nodes at the edges of the layer have a distance of one grid unit when 
wrapped. 
Example: 
topology using 
<< /rows 5 
/columns 4 
/elements /iaf_psc_alpha 
>> CreateLayer ; 
4 5	 Displacement 
[0.2 0.3] 5 Displacement


Parameters:

from_gid  	- int, gid of node in a topology layer 
from_pos  	- double vector, position in layer 
to_gid		- int, gid of node in a topology layer 
Returns: 
[double vector]	- vector pointing from position "from" to position "to"
