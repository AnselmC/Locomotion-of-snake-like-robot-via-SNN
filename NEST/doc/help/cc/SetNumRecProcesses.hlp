Name: SetNumRecProcesses - Set the number of MPI processes dedicated to 
 recording spikes.

Synopsis:

n_procs SetNumRecProcesses ->	-


Description:

Sets the number of recording MPI processes to n_procs. Usually, 
spike detectors are distributed over all processes and record 
from local neurons only. If a number of processes is dedicated to 
spike detection, each spike detector is hosted on one of these 
processes and records globally from all simulating processes.
