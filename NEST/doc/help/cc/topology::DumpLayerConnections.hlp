Name: topology::DumpLayerConnections - prints a list of the connections of the 
 nodes in the layer to file

Synopsis:

ostream source_layer_gid synapse_model DumpLayerConnections -> 
ostream


Examples:

topology using 
... 
(out.cnn) (w) file layer_gid /static_synapse PrintLayerConnections close


Description:

Dumps information about all connections of the given type having their source 
in the given layer to the given output stream. The data format is one line per 
connection as follows: 
source_gid target_gid weight delay displacement[x,y,z] 
where displacement are up to three coordinates of the vector from the source 
to the target node. If targets do not have positions (eg. spike detectors 
outside any layer), NaN is written for each displacement coordinate.


Parameters:

ostream		- open outputstream 
source_layer_gid	- topology layer 
synapse_model  	- synapse model (literal)


Remarks:

For distributed simulations 
	- this function will dump the connections with local targets only. 
	- the user is responsible for writing to a different output stream (file) 
on each MPI process.
