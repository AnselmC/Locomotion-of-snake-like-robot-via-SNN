Name: SetFakeNumProcesses - Set a fake number of MPI processes.

Synopsis:

n_procs SetFakeNumProcesses ->	-


Description:

Sets the number of MPI processes to n_procs. Used for benchmarking purposes 
of memory consumption only. 
Please note: 
	- Simulation of the network will not be possible after setting fake 
processes. 
	- It is not possible to use this function when running a script on multiple 
actual MPI processes. 
	- The setting of the fake number of processes has to happen before the kernel 
reset and before the setting of the local number of threads. 
After calling SetFakeNumProcesses, it is obligatory to call either 
ResetKernel or SetStatus on the Kernel for the setting of the fake 
number of processes to come into effect. 
A typical use case would be to test if a neuronal network fits on a machine 
of given size without using the actual resources. 
Example: 
%%% Set fake number of processes 
100 SetFakeNumProcesses 
ResetNetwork 
%%% Build network 
/iaf_psc_alpha 100 Create 
[1 100] Range /n Set 
<< /source n /target n >> Connect 
%%% Measure memory consumption 
memory_thisjob == 
Execute this script with 
mpirun -np 1 nest example.sli
