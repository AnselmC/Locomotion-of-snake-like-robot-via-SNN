Name: ResetKernel - Put the simulation kernel back to its initial state.

Description:

This function re-initializes the simulation kernel, returning it to the 
same state as after NEST has started. 
In particular, 
	- all network nodes 
	- all connections 
	- all user-defined neuron and synapse models 
are deleted, and 
	- time 
	- random generators 
are reset. The only exception is that dynamically loaded modules are not 
unloaded. This may change in a future version of NEST. The SLI interpreter 
is not affected by ResetKernel.
