Name: CGConnect - Establish connections contained in a ConnectionGenerator

Synopsis:

cg sources targets	 -> 	- 
cg sources targets params	 -> 	- 
cg sources targets	 syn_model -> 	- 
cg sources targets params syn_model -> 	-


Description:

CGConnect connects a source and a target population according to 
the rules defined in the given connection generator. params is an 
optional dictionary, that maps the names /weight and/or /delay to 
their integer index in the value set in the connection generator. 
If not specified, the synapse model is taken from the Options of 
the Connect command.


Parameters:

cg	 connectiongenerator		- ConnectionGenerator 
sources   gidcollection/array/intvector 	- the GIDs of the sources 
targets   gidcollection/array/intvector 	- the GIDs of the targets 
params	 dict (optional)  	- A map that translates the names /weight and 
/delay to indices in the value set 
syn_model  literal (optional)	- A literal specifying the synapse model
