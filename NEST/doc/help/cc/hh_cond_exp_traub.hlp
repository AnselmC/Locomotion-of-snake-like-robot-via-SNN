Name: hh_cond_exp_traub - Hodgin Huxley based model, Traub modified.

Description:

hh_cond_exp_traub is an implementation of a modified Hodkin-Huxley model 
(1) Post-synaptic currents 
Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change of conductance modeled 
by an exponential function. The exponential function is normalized such that an 
event of weight 1.0 results in a peak current of 1 nS. 
(2) Spike Detection 
Spike detection is done by a combined threshold-and-local-maximum search: if 
there is a local maximum above a certain threshold of the membrane potential, 
it is considered a spike. 
Problems/Todo: 
Only the channel variables m,h,n are implemented. The original 
contains variables called y,s,r,q and \chi.


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary. 
V_m	 double	- Membrane potential in mV 
V_T	 double	- Voltage offset that controls dynamics. For default 
parameters, V_T = -63mV results in a threshold around 
-50mV. 
E_L	 double	- Leak reversal potential in mV. 
C_m	 double	- Capacity of the membrane in pF. 
g_L	 double	- Leak conductance in nS. 
tau_syn_ex double	- Time constant of the excitatory synaptic exponential 
function in ms. 
tau_syn_in double	- Time constant of the inhibitory synaptic exponential 
function in ms. 
t_ref	 double	- Duration of refractory period in ms. 
E_ex	 double	- Excitatory synaptic reversal potential in mV. 
E_in	 double	- Inhibitory synaptic reversal potential in mV. 
E_Na	 double	- Sodium reversal potential in mV. 
g_Na	 double	- Sodium peak conductance in nS. 
E_K	 double	- Potassium reversal potential in mV. 
g_K	 double	- Potassium peak conductance in nS. 
I_e	 double	- External input current in pA.
