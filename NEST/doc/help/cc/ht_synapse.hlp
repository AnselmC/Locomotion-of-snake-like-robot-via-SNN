Name: ht_synapse - Synapse with depression after Hill & Tononi (2005).

Description:

This synapse implements the depression model described in [1, p 1678]. 
See docs/model_details/HillTononi.ipynb for details. 
Synaptic dynamics are given by 
P'(t) = ( 1	- P ) / tau_P 
P(T+) = (1	- delta_P) P(T-)   for T : time of a spike 
P(t=0) = 1 
w(t) = w_max * P(t)  is the resulting synaptic weight


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary: 
tau_P   double	- synaptic vesicle pool recovery time constant [ms] 
delta_P  double	- fractional change in vesicle pool on incoming spikes 
[unitless] 
P	 double	- current size of the vesicle pool [unitless, 0 <= P <= 1]


Sends:

SpikeEvent
