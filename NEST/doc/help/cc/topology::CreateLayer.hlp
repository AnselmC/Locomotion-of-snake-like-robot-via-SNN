Name: topology::CreateLayer - create a spatial layer of nodes

Synopsis:

dict CreateLayer -> layer


Description:

The Topology module organizes neuronal networks in 
layers. A layer is a special type of subnet which contains information 
about the spatial position of its nodes. There are three classes of 
layers: grid-based layers, in which each element is placed at a 
location in a regular grid; free layers, in which elements can be 
placed arbitrarily in space; and random layers, where the elements are 
distributed randomly throughout a region in space.  Which kind of layer 
this command creates depends on the elements in the supplied 
specification dictionary.


Parameters:

dict	- dictionary with layer specification
