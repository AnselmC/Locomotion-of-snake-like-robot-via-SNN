Name: music_event_in_proxy - A device which receives spikes from MUSIC.

Examples:

/music_event_in_proxy Create /meip Set 
meip << /music_channel 2 >> SetStatus 
/iaf_psc_alpha Create /n Set 
(event_in) 0.2 SetAcceptableLatency 
meip n Connect


Description:

A music_event_in_proxy can be used to pass spikes to nodes within NEST 
which are received from another application. 
It uses the MUSIC library to receive spike events from other 
applications. The music_event_in_proxy represents one channel on a port 
to which MUSIC can connect an event source. The music_event_in_proxy can 
be connected to local neurons or devices within NEST to receive 
the events. Multiple music_in_proxies can be configured to listen 
on the same port, but each channel can only listened to by a 
single proxy.


Parameters:

The following properties are available in the status dictionary: 
port_name		- The name of the MUSIC input port to listen to (default: 
event_in) 
music_channel 	- The MUSIC global index on the input port to listen to 
registered		- A bool indicating if the port has been already registered 
with the corresponding MUSIC event handler 
The parameters port_name and music_channel can be set using SetStatus. 
The acceptable latency of the MUSIC input port can be set using the 
command SetAcceptableLatency.
