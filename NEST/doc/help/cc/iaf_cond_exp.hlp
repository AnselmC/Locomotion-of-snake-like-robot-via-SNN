Name: iaf_cond_exp - Simple conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron 
 model.

Description:

iaf_cond_exp is an implementation of a spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with 
conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change 
of conductance modelled by an exponential function. The exponential function 
is normalised such that an event of weight 1.0 results in a peak conductance of 
1 nS.


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary. 
V_m	 double	- Membrane potential in mV 
E_L	 double	- Leak reversal potential in mV. 
C_m	 double	- Capacity of the membrane in pF 
t_ref	 double	- Duration of refractory period in ms. 
V_th	 double	- Spike threshold in mV. 
V_reset   double	- Reset potential of the membrane in mV. 
E_ex	 double	- Excitatory reversal potential in mV. 
E_in	 double	- Inhibitory reversal potential in mV. 
g_L	 double	- Leak conductance in nS; 
tau_syn_ex double	- Time constant of the excitatory synaptic exponential 
function in ms. 
tau_syn_in double	- Time constant of the inhibitory synaptic exponential 
function in ms. 
I_e	 double	- Constant external input current in pA.
