Name: iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with 
 multiple ports.

Description:

iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse is a direct extension of iaf_psc_exp. 
On the postsynapic side, there can be arbitrarily many synaptic 
time constants (iaf_psc_exp has exactly two: tau_syn_ex and tau_syn_in). 
This can be reached by specifying separate receptor ports, each for 
a different time constant. The port number has to match the respective 
"receptor_type" in the connectors.


Receives:

SpikeEvent, CurrentEvent, DataLoggingRequest 
Author:  Plesser, adapted from iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse
