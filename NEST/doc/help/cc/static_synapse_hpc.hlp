Name: static_synapse_hpc - Variant of static_synapse with low memory 
 consumption.

Description:

hpc synapses store the target neuron in form of a 2 Byte index instead of 
an 8 Byte pointer. This limits the number of thread local neurons to 
65,536. No support for different receptor types. Otherwise identical to 
static_synapse.
