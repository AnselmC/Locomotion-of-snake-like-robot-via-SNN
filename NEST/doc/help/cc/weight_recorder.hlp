Name: weight_recorder - Device for detecting single spikes.

Description:

The weight_recorder device is a recording device. It is used to record 
weights from synapses. Data is recorded in memory or to file as for all 
RecordingDevices. 
By default, source GID, target GID, time and weight of each spike is recorded. 
In order to record only from a subset of connected synapses, the 
weight_recorder accepts the parameters 'senders' and 'targets', with which the 
recorded data is limited to the synapses with the corresponding source or target 
gid. 
The weight recorder can also record weights with full precision 
from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes. Set /precise_times to 
achieve this. 
Data is not necessarily written to file in chronological order.
