Name: growth_curve_gaussian - Gaussian version of a growth curve

Description:

This class represents a Gaussian growth rule for the number of synaptic 
elements inside a neuron. The creation and deletion of synaptic elements 
when structural plasticity is enabled, allows the dynamic rewiring of the 
network during the simulation. 
This type of growth curve  uses a forward Euler integration method to update 
the number of synaptic elements: 
dz/dt = nu (2 * e^(- ((Ca(t)	- xi)/z)^2 )	- 1) 
where xi = (eta  + eps)/2, 
zeta = (eps	- eta)/2 * sqrt(ln(2))), 
eta is the minimum calcium concentration required for any synaptic element 
to be created, eps is the target mean calcium concentration in the neuron 
and nu is the growth rate in elements/ms. The growth rate nu is defined in 
the SynapticElement class.


Parameters:

eta	 double	-  Minimum amount of calcium concentration that the 
neuron needs to start creating synaptic elements. 
eta can have a negative value, making the growth 
curve move its maximum to the left. For example, if 
eta=-0.5 and eps=0.5 [Ca2+], the maximum growth rate 
(elements/ms) will be achieved at 0.0 [Ca2+]. If 
eta=0.0 [Ca2+] and eps=0.5 [Ca2+] the maximum growth 
rate will be achieved at 0.25 [Ca2+] while at 0.0 
[Ca+2] no new elements will be created. 
eps	 double	-  The target calcium concentration that 
the neuron should look to achieve by creating or 
deleting synaptic elements. It should always be a 
positive value.  It is important to note that the 
calcium concentration is linearly proportional to the 
firing rate. This is because dCa/dt =	- Ca(t)/tau_Ca 
+ beta_Ca if the neuron fires and dCa/dt =	- 
Ca(t)/tau_Ca otherwise, where tau_Ca is the calcium 
concentration decay constant and beta_Ca is the 
calcium intake constant (see SynapticElement class). 
This means that eps can also be seen as the desired 
firing rate that the neuron should achieve.  For 
example, an eps = 0.05 [Ca2+] with tau_Ca = 10000.0 
and beta_Ca = 0.001 for a synaptic element means a 
desired firing rate of 5Hz. 
nu	 double	-  Growth rate in elements/ms. The growth rate nu is 
defined in the SynapticElement class. Can be negative.
