Name: forallindexed - Call a procedure for each element of a list/string

Synopsis:

[v1,...,vn] {f} forallindexed ->  f(0,v1),...,f(n-1,vn)


Examples:

[(a) (b)]  {} forallindexed -> (a) 0 (b) 1


Description:

For each element of the input array, forallindexed calls f with 
two arguments, the element and its index within the list/string. 
forallindexed is similar to forall, only that the index of the 
element is also passed to the function f. 
Alternatives: Functions forallindexed_a for a list, forallindexed_s 
for a string (both undocumented) -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.


Parameters:

[v1,...,vn]	- list of n arbitrary objects or string 
{f}		- function which can operate on the elements of the 
array. f is not required to return a specific number 
of values.
