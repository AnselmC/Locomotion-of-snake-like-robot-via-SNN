Name: stdp_pl_synapse_hom - Synapse type for spike-timing dependent 
 plasticity with power law implementation using homogeneous parameters, i.e. 
 all synapses have the same parameters.

Description:

stdp_pl_synapse is a connector to create synapses with spike time 
dependent plasticity (as defined in [1]).


Parameters:

tau_plus  double	- Time constant of STDP window, potentiation in ms 
(tau_minus defined in post-synaptic neuron) 
lambda   double	- Learning rate 
alpha	 double	- Asymmetry parameter (scales depressing increments as 
alpha*lambda) 
mu	 double	- Weight dependence exponent, potentiation


Transmits:

SpikeEvent


Remarks:

The parameters can only be set by SetDefaults and apply to all synapses of 
the model.
