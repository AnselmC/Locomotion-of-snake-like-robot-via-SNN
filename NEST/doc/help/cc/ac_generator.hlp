Name: ac_generator - provides AC input current

Description:

This device produce an ac-current which are sent by a CurrentEvent. The 
current is given by 
I(t) = offset + amplitude * sin ( om * t + phi ) 
where 
om  = 2 * pi * frequency 
phi = phase / 180 * pi 
The parameters are 
amplitude   double	-  Amplitude of sine current in pA 
offset	 double	-  Constant amplitude offset in pA 
frequency   double	-  Frequency in Hz 
phase	 double	-  Phase of sine current (0-360 deg) 
Setting start and stop (see StimulatingDevice) only windows the current 
as defined above. It does not shift the time axis.


Sends:

CurrentEvent
