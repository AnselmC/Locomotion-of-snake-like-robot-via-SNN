Name: gamma_sup_generator - simulate the superimposed spike train of a 
 population of gamma process.

Description:

The gamma_sup_generator generator simulates the pooled spike train of a 
population of neurons firing independently with gamma process statistics.


Parameters:

The following parameters appear in the element's status dictionary: 
rate	 double	- mean firing rate of the component processes, 
default: 0s^-1 
gamma_shape  long  	- shape paramter of component gamma processes, default: 1 
n_proc	 long  	- number of superimposed independent component processes, 
default: 1


Remarks:

The generator has been published in Deger, Helias, Boucsein, Rotter (2011) 
Statistical properties of superimposed stationary spike trains, 
Journal of Computational Neuroscience.
