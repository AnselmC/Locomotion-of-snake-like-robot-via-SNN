Name: roll - Roll a portion n stack levels k times

Synopsis:

objn ... obj1 n k roll


Examples:

(a) (b) (c) 3 1  roll -> (c) (a) (b) 
(a) (b) (c) 3 -1 roll -> (b) (c) (a) 
(a) (b) (c) 3 0  roll -> (a) (b) (c)


Description:

roll performs a circular shift of the first n stack levels 
by k positions. Before this is done, roll removes its arguments 
from the stack. 
If k is positive, each shift consists of moving the contents of level 
0 to level n-1, thereby moving elements at levels 1 through n-1 up one 
stack level. 
If k is negative, each shift consists of moving the contents of level 
n-1 to level 0, thereby moving elements at levels 1 through n-1 down 
one stack level.


Diagnostics:

Raises StackUnderflow error if there are less than n+2 objects 
on the stack.
