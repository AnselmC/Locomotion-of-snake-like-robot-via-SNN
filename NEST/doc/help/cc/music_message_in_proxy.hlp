Description:

A music_message_in_proxy can be used to receive message strings from 
remote MUSIC applications in NEST. 
It uses the MUSIC library to receive message strings from other 
applications. The music_message_in_proxy represents an input port to 
which MUSIC can connect a message source. The music_message_in_proxy 
can queried using GetStatus to retrieve the messages.


Parameters:

The following properties are available in the status dictionary: 
port_name		- The name of the MUSIC input port to listen to (default: 
message_in) 
port_width		- The width of the MUSIC input port 
data		- A sub-dictionary that contains the string messages 
in the form of two arrays: 
messages		- The strings 
message_times	- The times the messages were sent (ms) 
n_messages		- The number of messages. 
published		- A bool indicating if the port has been already published 
with MUSIC 
The parameter port_name can be set using SetStatus. The field n_messages 
can be set to 0 to clear the data arrays.
