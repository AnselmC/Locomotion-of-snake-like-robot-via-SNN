 using the PGM (PortableGrayMap) format. 
 On Unix systems, man 5 pgm should give you a description of 
 the PGM image format.

 starting at the upper left corner and continuing 
 rowwise (normal english reading order).

 This writes an image named FancyImage.pgm with the gray values 
 from the array, having 16 columns and 24 rows.
