Name: dc_generator - provides DC input current

Examples:

The dc current can be altered in the following way: 
/dc_generator Create /dc_gen Set   % Creates a dc_generator, which is a node 
dc_gen GetStatus info	 % View properties (amplitude is 0) 
dc_gen << /amplitude 1500. >> SetStatus 
dc_gen GetStatus info	 % amplitude is now 1500.0


Description:

The DC-Generator provides a constant DC Input 
to the connected node. The unit of the current is pA.


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary: 
amplitude  double	- Amplitude of current in pA


Sends:

CurrentEvent


Remarks:

The dc_generator is rather inefficient, since it needs to 
send the same current information on each time step. If you 
only need a constant bias current into a neuron, you should 
set it directly in the neuron, e.g., dc_generator.
