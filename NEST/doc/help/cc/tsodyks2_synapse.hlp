Name: tsodyks2_synapse - Synapse type with short term plasticity.

Description:

This synapse model implements synaptic short-term depression and short-term 
facilitation according to [1] and [2]. It solves Eq (2) from [1] and 
modulates U according to eq. (2) of [2]. 
This connection merely scales the synaptic weight, based on the spike history 
and the parameters of the kinetic model. Thus, it is suitable for all types 
of synaptic dynamics, that is current or conductance based. 
The parameter A_se from the publications is represented by the 
synaptic weight. The variable x in the synapse properties is the 
factor that scales the synaptic weight.


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary: 
U	 double	- probability of release increment (U1) [0,1], 
default=0.5 
u	 double	- Maximum probability of release (U_se) [0,1], 
default=0.5 
x	 double	- current scaling factor of the weight, default=U 
tau_rec   double	- time constant for depression in ms, default=800 ms 
tau_fac   double	- time constant for facilitation in ms, default=0 (off)


Transmits:

SpikeEvent


Remarks:

Under identical conditions, the tsodyks2_synapse produces 
slightly lower peak amplitudes than the tsodyks_synapse. However, 
the qualitative behavior is identical. The script 
test_tsodyks2_synapse.py in the examples compares the two synapse 
models.
