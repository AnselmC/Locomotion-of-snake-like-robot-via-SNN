Name: cva_d - Convert dictionary to array

Synopsis:

dict cva_d -> array


Examples:

<< /a 1 /b 2>> cva_d -> [/a 1 /b 2]


Description:

cda converts a given dictionary to an array. 
The contents of the dictionay is mapped to the array in a 
form which is similar to the construction of an array, namely 
<< key1 val1 ... keyn valn>> cva_d -> [key1 val1 ... keyn valn]


Parameters:

dict is a dictionary which may be empty


Diagnostics:

no errors are issued.


Remarks:

The name follows the convention of PostScript and stands for 
ConVert to Array. 
Implementation: 
Class TokenMap provides an iterator which allows to step through the 
elements stored in the TokenMap. Member function begin() returns an 
iterator which points to the "first" element in the TokenMap and end() 
to the "last" element. operator ++ moves the iterator from one element 
to the next. Note, the iteration process itself does not define any 
order of the elements, e.g. in terms of the comparison operators. The 
only guaranteed function is that during the iteration from begin() to 
end() all elements in the TokenMap are accessed. 
Operator * applied to the iterator returns a pair. Member first of the 
pair is the key and member second is the value of the element the iterator 
points to.
