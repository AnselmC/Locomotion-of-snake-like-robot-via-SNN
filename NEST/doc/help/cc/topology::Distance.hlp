Name: topology::Distance - compute distance between nodes

Synopsis:

from_gid to_gid Distance -> double 
from_pos to_gid Distance -> double


Description:

This function returns the distance between the position of the "from_gid" 
node or the explicitly given "from_pos" position and the position of the 
"to_gid" node. Nodes must be parts of topology layers. 
The "from" position is projected into the layer of the "to_gid" node. If 
this layer has periodic boundary conditions (EdgeWrap is true), then the 
shortest distance is returned, taking into account the 
periodicity. Fixed grid layers are in this case extended so that the 
nodes at the edges of the layer have a distance of one grid unit when 
wrapped. 
Example: 
topology using 
<< /rows 5 
/columns 4 
/elements /iaf_psc_alpha 
>> CreateLayer ; 
4 5	 Distance 
[0.2 0.3] 5 Distance


Parameters:

from_gid  	- int, gid of node in a topology layer 
from_pos  	- double vector, position in layer 
to_gid		- int, gid of node in a topology layer 
Returns: 
double	- distance between nodes or given position and node
