Name: ResetNetwork - Reset the dynamic state of the network.

Synopsis:

ResetNetwork ->	-


Description:

ResetNetwork resets the dynamic state of the entire network to its state 
at T=0. The dynamic state comprises typically the membrane potential, 
synaptic currents, buffers holding input that has been delivered, but not 
yet become effective, and all events pending delivery. Technically, this 
is achieve by calling init_state() on all nodes and forcing a call to 
init_buffers() upon the next call to Simulate. Node parameters, such as 
time constants and threshold potentials, are not affected.


Remarks:

- Time and random number generators are NOT reset. 
	- Files belonging to recording devices (spike detector, multimeter, 
voltmeter, etc) are closed. You must change the file name before 
simulating again, otherwise the files will be overwritten and you 
will receive an error, depending on the value of /overwrite_files 
(in the root node). 
	- ResetNetwork will reset the nodes to the state values stored in the model 
prototypes. So if you have used SetDefaults to change a state value of a 
model since you called Simulate the first time, the network will NOT be 
reset to the status at T=0. 
	- The dynamic state of synapses with internal dynamics (STDP, facilitation) 
is NOT reset at present. This will be implemented in a future version 
of NEST.
