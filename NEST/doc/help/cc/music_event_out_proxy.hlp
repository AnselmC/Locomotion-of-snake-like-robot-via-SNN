port. The channel on the port to which a source node forwards its 
events is determined during connection setup by using the parameter 
music_channel of the connection. The name of the port is set via 
SetStatus (see Parameters section below).

port_name		- The name of the MUSIC output_port to forward events to 
(default: event_out)

published		- A bool indicating if the port has been already published 
with MUSIC 
The parameter port_name can be set using SetStatus.
