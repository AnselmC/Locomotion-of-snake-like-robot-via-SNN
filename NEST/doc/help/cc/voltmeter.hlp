Description:

A voltmeter records the membrane potential (V_m) of connected nodes 
to memory, file or stdout. 
By default, voltmeters record values once per ms. Set the parameter 
/interval to change this. The recording interval cannot be smaller 
than the resolution. 
Results are returned in the /events entry of the status dictionary, 
which contains membrane potential as vector /V_m and pertaining 
times as vector /times and node GIDs as /senders, if /withtime and 
/withgid are set, respectively. 
Accumulator mode: 
Voltmeter can operate in accumulator mode. In this case, values for all 
recorded variables are added across all recorded nodes (but kept separate in 
time). This can be useful to record average membrane potential in a 
population. 
To activate accumulator mode, either set /to_accumulator to true, or set 
/record_to [ /accumulator ].  In accumulator mode, you cannot record to file, 
to memory, to screen, with GID or with weight. You must activate accumulator 
mode before simulating. Accumulator data is never written to file. You must 
extract it from the device using GetStatus.


Parameters:

The following parameter can be set in the status dictionary: 
interval	 double	- Recording interval in ms

Remarks:

- The voltmeter model is implemented as a multimeter preconfigured to 
record /V_m. 
	- The set of variables to record and the recording interval must be set 
BEFORE the voltmeter is connected to any node, and cannot be changed 
afterwards. 
	- A voltmeter cannot be frozen. 
	- If you record with voltmeter in accumulator mode and some of the nodes 
you record from are frozen and others are not, data will only be collected 
from the unfrozen nodes. Most likely, this will lead to confusing results, 
so you should not use voltmeter with frozen nodes.
