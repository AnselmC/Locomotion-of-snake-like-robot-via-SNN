Name: tmpnam - Generate a string that is a valid non-existing file-name.

Synopsis:

tpmnam -> filename


Description:

This command is a thin wrapper around the POSIX.1 tmpnam() kernel function. 
The tmpnam function generates a string that is a valid filename and 
that is not the name of an existing file. The tmpnam function 
generates a different name each time it is called, (up to a number of 
times that is defined by the compiler macro TMP_MAX).
