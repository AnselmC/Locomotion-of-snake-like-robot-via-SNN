Name: mathexecutive - start interactive math session

Description:

Starts an interactive shell similar to the standard shell of SLI 
provided by the command executive. You can leave the shell by 
typing exit.

notation. The input is compiled with command CompileMath prior to 
execution.  See the documentation of CompileMath for the details of 
the syntax.


Remarks:

The syntax accepted by this command is experimental, be prepared for 
substantial changes.
