Name: nest_serial - Returns a non-distributed call of nest as a string 
 
 Synopsis:  (sli-filename) nest_serial -> (string with shell command)

Examples:

(hello.sli) nest_serial -> (mpirun -mca btl self,tcp -np 1 /home/dummy/nest/bin/nest hello.sli)


Description:

If nest was compiled with MPI it may be unsafe to directly call the binary to 
obtain a non-distributed version. The command nest_serial looks up the appropriate 
way to call nest and returns a suitable command as a string. The algorithm is as 
follows: 
1. if nest is not compiled with MPI, return "nest" 
2. if sli command /mpirun is defined, return this with 
the -np 1 equivalent 
3. issue and error with the message that nest was compiled with MPI 
but no method to call nest has been specified.


Diagnostics:

This function issues an error if NEST was compiled with MPI but is not aware of 
a safe method to call a non-distributed version of nest.
