Name: testsuite::ticket-451 - Guard against infinte loops in Random*Connect

Synopsis:

(ticket-451) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Random connection routines can hang in infinite loops if the user request 
more connections than possible if restrictions on multapses and autapses 
are taken into account. This test ensures that such conditions are caught.
