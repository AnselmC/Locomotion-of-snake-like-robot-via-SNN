Name: testsuite::test_iaf - sli script for overall test of iaf_neuron model

Synopsis:

(test_iaf) run -> compares response to current step with reference data


Description:

test_iaf.sli is an overall test of the iaf_neuron model connected 
to some useful devices. 
A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator 
device. The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are 
recorded by corresponding devices. 
It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike 
is emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally 
starts to recover. 
The timing of the various events on the simulation grid is of 
particular interest and crucial for the consistency of the 
simulation scheme. 
Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it 
is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1 
ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact 
representation of 0.1 ms. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script. The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file 
can be regenerated by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus 
call of vm below. 
Other test programs discuss the various aspects of this script in detail, 
see the SeeAlso key below.
