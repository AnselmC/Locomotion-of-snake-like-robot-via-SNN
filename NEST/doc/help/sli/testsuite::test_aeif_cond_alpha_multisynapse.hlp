Name: testsuite::test_aeif_cond_alpha_multisynapse - sli script for the aeif multisynapse model

Synopsis:

(test_aeif_cond_alpha_multisynapse) run


Description:

This test creates a multisynapse neuron and first checks if time constants 
can be set correctly. 
Afterwards, it simulates the mutisynapse neuron with n (n=4) different time 
constants and records the neuron's synaptic current. At the same time, it simulates 
n (n=4) single synapse neurons with according parameters. 
At the end, it compares the multisynapse neuron currents with each according single 
synapse current.
