Name: testsuite::test_dcgen_versus_I_e - sli script to test if setting I_e and applying a DC generator yields the same results.

Synopsis:

(test_dcgen_versus_I_e) run


Description:

This testscript checks consistency between currents coming from dc_generator and internal variable I_e; 
The approach is to simulate both situations for some time and compare membrane potentials at the end; 
Any model which supports current events and setting I_e is checked, other models are skipped.
