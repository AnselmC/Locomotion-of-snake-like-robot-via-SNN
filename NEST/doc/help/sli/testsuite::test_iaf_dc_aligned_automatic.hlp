Name: testsuite::test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic - sli script for test of iaf_neuron resolution independence

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic) run -> compare response with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic.sli is a modified version of 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli . 
The code of this program is now identical to 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli. Previous versions used a different 
definition of start which was not independent of the resolution. 
Therefore, an additional device property /on was required.  See 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_automatic.sli for details. 
The documentation below refers to the old definition of start 
The output generated is exactly identical to the output of the 
previous file. The dependence  of the simulation script on the 
computation step size is completely removed by using the capability 
of the DC generator to adjust the required starting time to the 
computation time step. This functionality is implemented in the Device 
base class and, thus, available to all devices. 
Instead of specifying the start time of the generator as in 
test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay.sli, the emission time of the first current 
event is specified. A device can only take action in a step t-h -> t. 
When t-h represents the start time of the device, t is the earliest time 
stamp of an emitted event. In our case the time stamp is the onset of the 
current. Thus, both times can not simultaneously be independent of the 
computation time step h. It is sufficient to specify one of the two measures, 
the other one is computed automatically. Internally, only the start time 
is stored. A warning is issued when both measures are specified because 
a difference other than h would be meaningless and a difference of h may 
not be representable by the two double values. In case both properties are 
specified, on  overrides start. The timer of the device does not rely on 
computing differences between doubles but uses the exact representation of 
time provided by the simulation kernel. 
An inspection of the property dictionary of the DC generator at different 
computation step sizes shows the relationship between DC generator 
on and start. 
h=0.1ms	 h=0.5ms 
<<	 << 
/start 1.9	 /start 1.5 
/on 2.0	 /on 2.0 
>>	 >> 
No output of the spike detector is visible here because of the short simulation 
time of only 6 ms. Set the simulation time to larger values to verify the 
consistency of voltage meter and spike detector. 
The expected output is documented at the end of the script.
