Name: testsuite::test_gif_cond_exp_multisynapse - sli script for test of 
 gif_cond_exp_multisynapse with external DC current and spike generators

Synopsis:

(test_gif_cond_exp_multisynapse) run


Description:

This testscript checks the correctness of gif_cond_exp_multisynapse neuron 
model. It injects external DC current and also six spikes to neuron and 
measures its spike times. The spike times should match the expected values. 
The expected spike times are computed by the Python code used for the 
publication (Code/GIF.py in 
http://wiki.epfl.ch/giftoolbox/documents/GIF_Toolbox.zip). 
In order to use the Python code, the adaptation parameters (q_stc/sfa) should 
be converted using the formula described in the model documentation.
