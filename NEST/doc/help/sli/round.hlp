Name: round - Round double to the nearest integer

Synopsis:

double round -> double 
integer round -> double


Examples:

1.4 round  --> 1.0 
1.5 round  --> 2.0 
2   round  --> 2.0


Description:

Alternatives: Function round_d (undocumented) 
-> behaviour and synopsis are the same.


Remarks:

round_d is currently defined in SLI, 
could be implemented in C++ for efficiency. 
On 130610 it was decided that round applied to an integer 
should be the identity function. 
Update: In a later discussion, it was decided to make round 
return a double in this case as well.


Author:

introduced non-trie-variant round_d, Ruediger Kupper.
