Name: unittest::distributed_collect_assert_or_die - Checks whether result is independent of number of number of jobs

Synopsis:

array proc proc distributed_collect assert_or_die ->	- 
array proc	 distributed_collect assert_or_die ->	-


Description:

The array specifies a list of numbers of 
jobs. distributed_collect_assert_or_die executes the procedure specified as 
the second argument in parallel for all of the numbers of jobs given 
in the arrays. This means that distributed_collect_assert_or_die carries out 
as many distributed simulations as there are entries in the array. 
In each of the simulations all jobs are expected to return a value on 
the stack. The order in which the jobs are completed is of no 
importance.  After completion of all simulations 
distributed_collect_assert_or_die compares the sets of results of all 
the simulations using the comparison function supplied by the second 
procedure. If the second procedure is not given it requires that all 
jobs of all runs return true. 
A variant of this function distributed_collect_assert_or_die 
requires that the contents of all sets of results is identical. The 
order of the results in each set is irrelevant. 
distributed_collect_assert_or_die assumes that it is called from a 
file and that this file contains only a single call of 
distributed_collect_assert_or_die because all distributed instances of 
the simulator will rerun this file.  In addition the function assumes 
that the test file is run with a version of nest capable of spawning 
further instances of nest.  This can be assured by using nest_indirect 
instead of the nest binary directly. The test file should not make the 
call of distributed_collect_assert_or_die or the termination of the 
test file depending on the status flags is_mpi or have_mpi. This would 
interfere with the proper control flow and the status flags have 
already been checked by nest_indirect at this point.
