Name: whos - list contents of all dictionaries on the dicitonary stack

Synopsis:

whos ->	-


Description:

whos prints the contents of all dictionaries which are cunnrently 
on the dictionary stack to the standard output. 
Dictionaries are printed from bottom to top, i.e. 
systemdict then userdict and then all additional dictionaries (if any).

taken from Matlab. 
The listing would be more legible with a pager. If you 
want to pass the output to a stream, use info_ds instead.
