Name: testsuite::test_iaf_min_delay_create - sli script for testing automatic adjustment of min_delay

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_min_delay_create) run -> compares results for different min_delays


Description:

The simulation is run with a range of different min_delays. All 
should give identical results. This is achieved by sampling the 
membrane potential at a fixed interval. 
The min_delay is specified by creating a corresponding 
connection.  The companion test test_iaf_min_delay_set sets 
the value explicitly as a default value of the synapse type. 
Other test scripts discuss the various aspects of this script in detail, 
see the SeeAlso key below. If this test fails go back to the simpler ones.
