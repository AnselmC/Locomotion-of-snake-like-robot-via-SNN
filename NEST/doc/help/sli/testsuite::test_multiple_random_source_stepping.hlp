Name: testsuite::test_multiple_random_source_stepping - test NEST's behavior when using multiple random sources and different stepping schemes

Synopsis:

(test_multiple_random_source_stepping.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

The script checks whether simulations of a network with more than one node consuming random numbers 
creates identical output under different stepping regimes, e.g., 1x10.0ms vs 100x0.1ms. 
Per r9131, this tests works well only if the stepping interval is a multiple of the minimal delay. 
Otherwise, random numbers will be fed to consumers in different orders, as nodes are updated for 
parts of minimal delay periods only.
