Name: testsuite::test_pp_pop_psc_delta - sli script for test of pp_pop_psc_delta

Synopsis:

(test_pp_pop_psc_delta) run -> compare numbers of generated spikes of the model and a group of pp_psc_delta neurons


Description:

This script simulate three point process population models with different sets of parameters. After each simulation, it compares 
the number of generated spikes by the model and the same quantity of a group of pp_psc_delta neurons. The parameters of 
pp_psc_delta neurons (including the number of neurons) are the same as represented in the point process population model. 
The ratio of number of spikes must not be less than 1-err and greater than 1+err. Here we choose err=0.2.
