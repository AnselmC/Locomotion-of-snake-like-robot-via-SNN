Name: testsuite::ticket-737 - Ensure that stimulating devices can only be connected with a single synapse type

Synopsis:

(ticket-737) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Ensure that NEST throws an exception if one tries to connect poisson_generator 
(sending DSSpikeEvents), noise_generator (sending DSCurrentEvents) or multimeter 
(sending DataLoggingRequest) to a neuron using a plastic synapse. 
spike_generator slips through this test, since it usually sends SpikeEvent. But it 
is no danger if it sends DSSpikeEvents for weighted spikes, since it sends precisely 
one DSSpikeEvent per spike.
