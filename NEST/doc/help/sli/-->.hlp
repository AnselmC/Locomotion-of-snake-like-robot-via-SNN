Name: --> - longrightarrow, usually delayed comparison

Synopsis:

--> -> /-->


Examples:

[8 --> 6] --> 8 /--> cvx exec 6  3 arraystore


Description:

The symbol --> is used in the example sections of the NEST 
documentation to indicate the transformation an operator 
performs to its arguments. The SLI operator --> is defined 
to just reproduce itself. This enables NEST to evaluate the 
example sections as regular SLI code. As a result, the arguments 
of the documented operator and its results are separated by 
the literaal /-->. A parser for infix notation can then apply 
the documented operator to the values on the left side of --> 
and compare the results to the values on the right side of -->


Remarks:

The idea of --> is to contribute to a notation for test driven 
programming and user documentation which keeps the syntactic 
clutter at a minimum.
