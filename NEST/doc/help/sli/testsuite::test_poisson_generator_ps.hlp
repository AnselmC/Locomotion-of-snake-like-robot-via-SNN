Name: testsuite::test_poisson_generator_ps - basic test of poisson_generator_ps

Synopsis:

(test_poisson_generator_ps) run -> fails if targets receive identical spikes trains


Description:

This basic test checks whether two targets receive different spikes trains 
and whether the start and stop properties of the generator are respected. 
The test does neither check that spikes indeed have high resolution nor 
that grid-constrained neuron models receive consistent spike times.


Remarks:

This test fails for a correct implementation if in the simulation interval both targets 
receive no spikes. The seed set in the default configuration of NEST avoids this 
problem. Therefore, failure of this script indicates that the configuration is not 
portable.
