1. (Something happened) M_STATUS message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:23:12 SLI[5] Still alive 
3. (Your last action had no effect) M_INFO message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:12 SLI[10] Your last action had no effect 
4. (Function is deprecated) M_DEPRECATED message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:12 SLI[18] Function is deprecated 
5. (Result may be invalid) M_WARNING message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:24 SLI[20] Result may be invalid 
6. (This should never happen!) M_ERROR message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:36 SLI[30] This should never happen! 
7. (It's all broken, let's go home.) M_FATAL message 
issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:36 SLI[40] It's all broken, let's go home.

issues something like 
% Jul 21 16:24:36 DEBUGMESSAGE[30] This should never happen! 
Depending on the verbosity-level, the output may be suppressed.


Description:

Display a message, if priority is higher than current verbosity-level. 
message uses the message mechanism which is provided 
by the SLIInterpreter class. 
The output consists of a time-stamp (date and time), the name of the 
calling function, the priority level and the message text. 
% month dd hh:mm::ss from[pl] messagetext 
Where 
month	- abbreviated month (Jan-Dec) 
dd  	- day in month (01-31) 
hh  	- hour (00-23) 
mm  	- minute (00-61) 
ss  	- seconds (00-61) 
from 	- name of the caller, defaults to (SLI) in the short form 
pl  	- priority level of the message 
The time-stamp is useful during long-running simulations. 
All output is sent to the stream defined in M_OUT which is 
set to cout by default. 
The verbosity level can be controlled by the functions 
verbosity and setverbosity. For compatibility, the function 
shutupto is still supported as alias to setverbosity.


Parameters:

In : (MyMessage: Message to display 
Priority  : Priority level of message (integer). 
Opt: (From)   : Name of the caller of class of message.


Bugs:




Remarks:

M_* values are defined in system dictionary. 
You may introduce new priority levels in the user dictionary if convenient. 
Standard values are: M_ALL	 = 0 
M_DEBUG	 = 5 
M_STATUS	 = 7 
M_INFO	 = 10 
M_DEPRECATED = 18 
M_WARNING   = 20 
M_ERROR	 = 30 
M_FATAL	 = 40 
M_QUIET	 = 100 
Standard output:	 M_OUT	 = cout
