Name: testsuite::ticket-459 - test that changing the leak reversal potential leaves all other neuron parameters else unchanged

Synopsis:

(ticket-459.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

For all models having a reversal potential E_L, we change this potential and check that 
all other parameters and properties of the model remain unchanged. #459 reports that the 
order in which E_L and V_th are set determines which values are actually set. This is a 
direct consequence of incorrect handling of changes to E_L, which show up as changes in, 
e.g. V_m and V_th as a side effect of changing E_L. This happened in those neuron models 
that internally represent voltages relative to E_L and did not adjust those values on 
changes to E_L.
