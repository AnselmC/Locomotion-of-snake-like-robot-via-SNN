Name: testsuite::test_gif_psc_exp - sli script for test of gif_psc_exp with 
 external DC current and spike generators

Synopsis:

(test_gif_psc_exp) run


Description:

This testscript checks the correctness of gif_psc_exp neuron model. It injects 
external DC current and also three spikes to neuron and measures its spike 
times. The spike times should match the expected values. The expected spike 
times are computed by the Python code used for the publication (Code/GIF.py in 
http://wiki.epfl.ch/giftoolbox/documents/GIF_Toolbox.zip). 
In order to use the Python code, the adaptation parameters (q_stc/sfa) should 
be converted using the formula described in the model documentation.
