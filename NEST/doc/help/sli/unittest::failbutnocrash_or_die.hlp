Name: unittest::failbutnocrash_or_die - Execute a code block and exit with exit code 3 if it does not raise a scripterror

Synopsis:

{ code } [string] failbutnocrash_or_die ->	-


Examples:

{add}	 (add ok) failbutnocrash_or_die  -> success 
{1 0 div} failbutnocrash_or_die  -> success 
{add_dd}  failbutnocrash_or_die  -> quit


Description:

The procedure tests that a specific error, a scripterror, is raised. An example 
is a call of operator add in a situation where the operand stack is empty. add 
raises a StackUnderflow error in this case which is a scripterror and the desired 
behavior. There are several alternative and undesired behaviors of the code block 
in question. add may return without raising an error, this is not the expected behavior 
and therefore failbutnocrash_or_die reports a problem. However, other scenarios 
are that the code block causes an assertion to fail or that it causes a segmentation 
fault. In contrast to fail_or_die, failbutnocrash_or_die survives such a crash of 
the code block to be tested. This is achieved by probing the code block in a separate 
nest instance and inspecting the result. The procedure uses the symbolic exit codes 
defined in statusdict::exitcodes, scripterror is one of them.


Diagnostics:

This function will quit nest  (exit code 3) if the code does NOT raise an error of the 
scripterror type. It will print an error message to cerr, too.
