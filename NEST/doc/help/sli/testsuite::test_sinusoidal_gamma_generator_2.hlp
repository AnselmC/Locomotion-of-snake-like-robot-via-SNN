Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_2 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Gammaian trains with individual spike trains

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_2.sli ->	-


Description:

Creates a sinusoidally modulated Gamma generator emitting 
individual spike trains to each of its targets and sends spikes to 
spike detector. Assert invariant results for fixed VP number. This 
is a partial response to #551. May be adapted to other generators. 
Author:  December 2012, May 2013, Plesser, based on test_gamma_generator.sli
