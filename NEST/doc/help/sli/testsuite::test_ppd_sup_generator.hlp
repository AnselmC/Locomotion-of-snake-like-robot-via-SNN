Name: testsuite::test_ppd_sup_generator - sli script for test of ppd_sup_generator output

Synopsis:

(test_ppd_sup_generator) run -> compare spike train statistics with expectations


Description:

test_ppd_sup_generator is a collection of tests which require basic 
functionality of the generator. It tests 
1) if the firing rate of a superposition is close to the preset one. 
2) if the coefficient of variation of a superposition agrees with theory 
3) if a fixed dead-time is respected absolutely in case of a single generated 
process. 
4) if the coefficient of variation of a single process agrees with theory 
5) if the spike trains generated for two different targets differ 
All of these tests are based on random number realizations, which is 
necessarily so  since the model is stochastic. There is thus a finite 
probability of test failure, even if everything is fine. The choice of the 
variable err, which is the allowed relative deviation from the reference value, 
can be used to make the test more or less strict. Increasing T inside the test 
functions can also help to get more reliable statistics and a reduced 
probability of false alarms. 
The values are chosen to have a reasonable execution time. False alarm were 
never observed yet. Since random numbers are preserved through repetitions of 
the simulations, the test should work for sure as long as the random number 
generation procedure of nest is not changed. If it is changed, failure of the 
test is still very unlikely. 
The intention of this script is to make sure that there are no gross errors in 
the main functions of the ppd_sup_generator. It does not test the sinusoidal 
hazard feature yet.


Remarks:

This test script was adapted from test_pp_psc_delta.sli
