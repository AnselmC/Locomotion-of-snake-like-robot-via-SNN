Name: endusing - Close the scope of a 'using' context.

Synopsis:

/namespacename using ...your.code... endusing ->	-


Examples:

% the following makes the routines of the unittest library available to the current scope: 
(unittest) run 
/unittest using 
..your code.. 
endusing


Description:

'endusing' must be used to close a 'using' statement. 
For further information, see 'using'.


Remarks:

Please note that 'using'/'endusing' is implemented by the opening and 
closing of dictionaries. Code between 'using' and 'endusing' should 
hence have completely matched 'begin' and 'end' statements, or special 
care must be taken when using non-matched 'begin'/'end' constructs 
inside a 'using' context.
