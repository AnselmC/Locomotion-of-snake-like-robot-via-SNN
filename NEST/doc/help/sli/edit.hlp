Name: edit - Open a file in an external editor

Synopsis:

(filename) edit ->	-


Examples:

(helloworld.sli) edit


Description:

Opens the file specified by filename.


Parameters:

The name of a file to be edited (or created, if non-existent).


Options:

/command	- UNIX command to edit a file (default: see below) 
/command can be either false or a string. 
If /command is set to false, "edit" will issue a message that informs 
about how to set the editor 
If it is set to the name of a UNIX program, "edit" will execute 
this program as a child process, passing the name of the 
file as argument. 
/command defaults to the contents of the $EDITOR environment 
variable. If this variable is not set, it defaults to false. 
/wait	- whether to wait for the UNIX program to finish. (default: true) 
If /wait is set to true, the "edit" command will not return until 
the UNIX process is terminated. Use this setting for all editors 
that use the terminal exclusively. 
If /wait is set to false, "edit" will return immediately after 
creating the child process. Use this setting for all editors that 
open up their own window. 
The value of /wait is ignored, if /command is set to false.


Bugs:




Remarks:

The location of the file is only specified by the parameter; 
SLISearchPath is not scanned as e.g. in 'run'.
