Name: testsuite::test_psp_amplitude_consistency - test the consistency of PSP amplitudes across models.

Synopsis:

(test_psp_amplitude_consistency) run ->


Description:

This test computes the peak amplitude of the post-synaptic potential 
for different neuron models and checks whether their PSP peak 
amplitudes match approximately. 
The maximal PSP amplitude is computed for different synaptic time 
constants to ensure that the scaling of the post-synaptic response is 
consinstent between models.
