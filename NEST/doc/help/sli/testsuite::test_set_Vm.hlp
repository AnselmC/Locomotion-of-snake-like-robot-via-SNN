Name: testsuite::test_set_Vm - test if setting V_m work via SetModelStatus and SetStatus

Synopsis:

(test_set_Vm) run -> dies if assertion fails


Description:

This test goes through all models in modeldict for which V_m can be 
set, and attempts to set V_m via SetModelStatus and SetStatus. It then 
compares results. If both ways of setting V_m give different results, 
something is wtong with state initialization.


Remarks:

The tests exploits that almost all neuron models have a state variable 
V_m. It ignores all other models (the test returns true for them). The 
new membrane potential that is set it the potential found in the 
neuron +0.1mV. This should not conflict with any limitation requiring 
the potential to be set to subthreshold values, but in pathological 
cases it may lead to the exclusion of a model that should be tested.
