Name: searchifstream - searches SLI's search path for a file

Synopsis:

string searchifstream -> istreamtype true 
-> false


Examples:

(sli-init.sli) searchifstream opens sli-init.sli for reading 
since the path to system sli files is contained in SLISearchPath.


Description:

searchifstream calls searchfile to open the file specified in 
string for reading. Searchfile will use the Search path mechanism, 
trying any path in SLISearchPath. 
If searchfile fails, operator tries to add .sli to the name. 
Returns a pointer to the stream for reading and true to 
indicate success if filename or filename.sli is a valid file, 
otherwise returns false.


Parameters:

string is a filename with full path information or a file found 
within one of the Pathes specified in SLISearchPath.
