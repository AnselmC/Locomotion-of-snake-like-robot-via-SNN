Name: testsuite::ticket-683 - Ensure that NEST raises error when number of threads changed too late.

Synopsis:

(ticket-683) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Ensures that NEST throws an error if the number of threads is being changed after 1. custom neuron 
models have been created or 2. model defaults have been changed. Each test is also run with 
number of threads changed first, this should work.
