Name: GetConnections - Retrieve connections between nodes

Synopsis:

<< /source [sgid1 sgid2 ...] 
/target [tgid1 tgid2 ...] 
/synapse_model /smodel 
/synapse_label label	 >> GetConnections -> [ conn1 conn2 ... ]


Description:

1. If called with an empty dictionary, GetConnections returns all connections of the 
network, as a list of arrays (IntVectorDatum), one array per connection. 
2. Each array (connection object) has the following elements: 
[source-gid target-gid target-thread synapse-model-id port] 
3. The optional dictionary elements /source and /target can be used to filter 
for specific pre- and post-synaptic neurons, respectively. 
4. The optional parameter /synapse_model can be used to filter for a specific synapse model. 
5. The optional parameter /synapse_label can be used to filter for a specific synapse label. 
6. In a parallel simulation, GetConnections only returns connections with *targets* 
on the MPI process executing the function.


Parameters:

A dictionary that may contain the following fields (all are optional): 
/source 	- array with GIDs of presynaptic nodes whose connections are sought. 
If not given, all neurons are searched as sources. 
/target 	- array with GIDs of post-synaptic nodes whose connections are sought. 
If not given, all neurons are searched as targets. 
/synapse_model	- literal specifying synapse model 
If not given, connections of all synapse models are returned. 
/synapse_label	- integer specifying synapse label 
If not given, connections of all synapse labels are returned.


Remarks:

1. See synapsedict for the synapse-model-id's for all synapse models. 
2. The /synapse_label property can only be assigned to synapse models with names ending 
with '_lbl'. All other synapses have the default synapse_label UNLABELED_CONNECTION (-1). 
3. The "port" enumerates connections per source, thread and synapse model. It is 
mainly important for NEST internally. 
4. In OpenMP mode, GetConnections works thread-parallel for better performance. 
5. Connection objects can be converted to SLI lists with cva. 
6. Connection objects can be passed to SetSynapseStatus, GetSynapseStatus, and DataConnect
