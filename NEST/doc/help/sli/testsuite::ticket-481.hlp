Name: testsuite::ticket-481 - Ensure that poisson_generator_ps delivers spikes to more than one node

Synopsis:

(ticket-481) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Ensure that poisson_generator_ps delivers spikes to more than one node. 
Peiran Gao reported to nest_bugs that poisson_generator_ps. 
First analysis indicates that spikes are lost if poisson_generator_ps is connected 
to target neurons using different synapse models, even if those are just copies of 
the same underlying class.
