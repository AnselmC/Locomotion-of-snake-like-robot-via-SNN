Name: testsuite::test_iaf_min_delay_set - sli script for testing explicit specification of min_delay

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_min_delay_set) run -> compares results for different min_delays


Description:

The simulation is run with a range of different min_delays. All 
should give identical results. This is achieved by sampling the 
membrane potential at a fixed interval. 
The min_delay is specified by explicitly setting the corresponding 
default property of a synapse type. The companion test 
test_iaf_min_delay_create sets the value by creating a corresponding 
connection. 
Other test scripts discuss the various aspects of this script in detail, 
see the SeeAlso key below. If this test fails go back to the simpler ones.
