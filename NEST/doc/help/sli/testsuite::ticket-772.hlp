Name: testsuite::ticket-772 - NEST should not crash, if integer values for weight/ delay are used

Synopsis:

(ticket-772) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Different connecting functions support passing TokenArrays for weights and delays. 
The values for weight and delays are expected to be doubles, but passing them 
as integers should not crash NEST. SLI's casting function getValue<double> 
in tokenutils.cc is strict and throws a TypeMisMatch, if something different 
from a DoubleDatum should be casted to a double. 
This test tests the relevant connecting functions.
