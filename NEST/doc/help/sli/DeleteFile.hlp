Name: DeleteFile - Delete a file

Synopsis:

string DeleteFile -> boolean


Examples:

(DontNeedYou) DeleteFile -> True, and DontNeedYou is removed 
from your working directory 
if this file existed, 
otherwise False.


Description:

Delete a file defined by it's filename. To be exact, it 
is unlinked, so if it link to another file, only the link and not 
the file is removed. (This is at least what is supposed to happen 
if your POSIX is really POSIX ...) 
Mind that regex arguments like (*) DeleteFile are NOT supported. 
This was done for safety reasons because the regex flavour of 
POSIX is not exactly like what one might be used to from UNIX, 
which could easily end in a disaster.


Parameters:

string : Filename of file to be deleted. 
boolean : A flag if operation succeded.
