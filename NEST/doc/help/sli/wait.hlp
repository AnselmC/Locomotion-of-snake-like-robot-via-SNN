Name: wait - Wait for any child process to terminate

Synopsis:

NoHangFlag wait -> Status NormalExitFlag PIDout 
-> 0


Examples:

false wait %wait for the next child to terminate


Description:

Wait is the same as "waitPID", but it waits for any 
child process. 
Alternatives: Function wait_b (undocumented) -> behaviour and 
synopsis are the same, except that no warnings or error 
messages are thrown.


Parameters:

In : NoHangFlag(boolean): -see waitPID- 
Out: Status(integer) 
NormalExitFlag(boolean) 
PIDout(integer): -see waitPID-


Bugs:




Remarks:

This is not a SLI-interface to the system's "wait()"-function, 
but a thin wrapper to waitPID. The behaviour is exactly the 
same, however.
