Name: exithook - Procedure executed if the executive mode is left.

Description:

The task of exithook is to handle accidental exits from the 
interactive executive session. The most common reason is 
the use of 'exit' when the user wants to quit the interpreter. 
By default, exithook will issue a message and restart the executive 
mode. 
If you would like to quit the interpreter, put the following code 
into your .nestrc file 
/exithook {quit} def 
For debugging it is often useful to be able to access the fallback 
input which has no prompt. For this, put the following code to your 
.nestrc file 
/exithook {} def
