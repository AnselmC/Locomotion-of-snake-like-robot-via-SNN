Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse - sli script for the multisynapse model

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse) run


Description:

This test creates a multisynapse neuron and first checks if time constants 
can be set correctly. 
Afterwards a neuron with four synaptic time constants with different weights and delays 
is simulated and the resulting membrane potential values after the income of one spike 
are checked against analytically obtained values. 
The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file can be regenerated 
by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus call of vm below.
