Name: arraylib::EdgeTruncate - Truncate 2-d array indices at array edges

Synopsis:

[2d-indices] height width EdgeTruncate -> [truncated-2d-indices]


Description:

This function iterates through the given array indices and checks if 
they lie inside the bounds [0,height) and [0,width), respectively. 
Indices are modified according to the following rules: 
1. If both indices lie inside [0,height) and [0,width), respectively, 
they are left untouched. 
2. If either the row index lies outside [0,height), or the column 
index lies outside [0,width), the respective index is replaced by "false". 
Note that by NEST convention, for index pairs, the first index denotes 
the row, and the second index denotes the column. 
Dimensions of the index array are preserved.


Diagnostics:

The index array is expected to be a (nested) array of integer values 
only. Code will break otherwise.


Remarks:

The index array is expected to be a (nested) array of integer values only.
