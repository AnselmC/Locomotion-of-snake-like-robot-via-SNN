Name: LambertW0 - principal branch of the Lambert-W function

Synopsis:

double LambertW0 -> double


Examples:

The Lambert-W function has applications in many areas as described in [1] and [3]. 
For example, the solution of 
exp(s) = 1 + a*s 
with respect to s can be written in closed form as 
s=1/a * (-aW(-exp(-1/a)/a) -1 ) 
Version: 090818


Description:

The Lambert-W function [1] is the inverse function of x=W*exp(W). For real values of 
x and W, the function W(x) is defined on [-1/e,\infty). On the interval [-1/e,0) 
it is double valued. The two branches coincide at W(-1/e)=-1. The so called 
principal branch LambertW0 continuously grows (W>=-1) and crosses the origin (0,0). 
The non-principal branch LambertWm1 is defined on [-1/e,0) and declines to -\infty for 
growing x. 
NEST uses the GSL [2] implementations of LambertW0 and LambertWm1 if available and 
falls back to to the iterative scheme LambertW suggested in [1] if not. 
The GSL interfaces for LambertW0 and LambertWm1 are in the SpecialFunctionsModule 
of SLI.
