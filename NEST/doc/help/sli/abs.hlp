Name: abs - absolute value 
 Synopsis:  value abs -> value

Examples:

-3 abs -> 3 
3 abs -> 3 
-3.456 abs -> 3.456


Description:

implemented by C/C++ 
long   labs(long) and 
double fabs(double) 
Alternatives: Functions abs_i for integers, abs_d for doubles 
(SeeAlso) -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.


Remarks:

If you are not sure, if the value is of type double or 
integer, use abs. 
If e.g. abs_d gets an integer as argument, NEST will exit throwing an assertion.
