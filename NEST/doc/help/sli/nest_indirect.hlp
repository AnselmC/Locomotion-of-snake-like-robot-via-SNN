Name: nest_indirect - Returns a nest call as a string able to spawn distributed simulations 
 
 Synopsis:  (sli-filename) nest_indirect -> (string with shell command)

Examples:

(hello.sli) nest_indirect -> (/home/dummy/nest/bin/sli hello.sli)


Description:

If a task requires multiple distributed simulations with different 
numbers of processors NEST needs to be compiled with support for distributed 
computing and be aware of the corresponding method to start itself. However, 
some libraries for distributed computing do not support the nested call of 
further processes. Therefore, nest_indirect provides a serial environment 
for the preparation of the distributed simulations. 
The algorithm is as follows: 
1. if nest is not compiled with MPI, quit with fatal error 
2. if sli command /mpirun is not defined, quit with fatal error 
3. return "sli"


Diagnostics:

This function quits nest with a fatal error if there is no support for 
distributed computing or NEST does not know how to start a distributed version 
of itself.
