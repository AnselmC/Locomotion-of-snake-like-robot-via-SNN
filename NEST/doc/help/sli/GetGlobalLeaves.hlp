Name: GetGlobalLeaves - Return IDs of all leaves of a subnet that fulfill the 
 conditions given in the dictionary, or all leaves if no dictionary given.

Synopsis:

gid [<<dict>>]  GetGlobalLeaves -> [gid1 ... gidn]


Description:

This function recursively traverses a subnet and returns the global 
ids of all leaf nodes in increasing order of gid.  If a dictionary is provided, 
only those nodes which fulfill the given criteria are returned. 
The returned nodes DO NOT include the intermediate subnets. For a 
variant of this command that also returns the subnets, see 
"GetGlobalNodes".


Parameters:

gid		- id of a subnet 
<<dict>>	- Dictionary of selection properties 
Returns: 
[gid..]	- Array with the global ids of all leaf nodes.
