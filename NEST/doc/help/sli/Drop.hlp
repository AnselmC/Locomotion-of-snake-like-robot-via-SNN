Name: Drop - remove element sequences from an array

Synopsis:

array  n Drop	 remove the first n elements 
array -n Drop	 remove the last n elements 
array [n] Drop	 remove the nth element 
array [n1 n2] Drop	 remove elements n1 through n2 
array [n1 n2 s] Drop	 remove elements n1 through n2 in steps of s 
array {[seq1]...[seqn]} Drop   return a nested list in which elements 
specified by seqi are removed at level i in list.


Examples:

[4 9 -7 3 2 11] 2 Drop   --> [-7 3 2 11] 
[4 9 -7 3 2 11] -2 Drop   --> [4 9 -7 3] 
[1 2 3 4 5] [-2] Drop	 --> [1 2 3 5] 
[1 2 3 4 5] [1 -2] Drop   --> [5] 
[1 2 3 4 5] [1 -2 2] Drop --> [2 4 5] 
[1 2 3 4 5] [1 -1 2] Drop --> [2 4] 
[[-9 -12] [6 7]] {[2] [1]} Drop --> [[-12]]


Bugs:

The list of sequences is represented by a procedure. This has delayed 
evaluation which may cause undesired effects. Should be replaced in a 
future versionby a new container type for parameter lists of undefined 
length. Candidate delimiters are <...> with cva as the only access method. 
Just using [...] as the container is ambiguous.
