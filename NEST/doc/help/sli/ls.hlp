Synopsis:

ls ->	-


Examples:

There's only one usage: 
ls -> see contents of current working directory


Description:

Prints the contents of the working directory on stdout.

be set like -l, -a ! 
Any files starting with a . are NOT shown by default. 
Use FileNames if you need them.

Bugs:




Remarks:

This is in fact not much more than a wrapper to FileNames, 
in addition using a regex to filter out ".anything" files.
