Name: ReadList - read a list of specified format from a stream

Synopsis:

istream [types] ReadList -> [result]


Examples:

istream [/Number /Number] ReadList -> [[1 2] [3 4] ...] 
istream [/Number] ReadList -> [1 2 3 4 ...]


Description:

ReadList reads the rest of a file into an array. If [types] contains 
more than one type specifier, the array is constructed from subarray with 
elements of the types, specified by  [types]. 
ReadList tries to allocate the result array in advance. The option 
BufferSize can be specified to optimize this behaviour. 
The valid type specifiers are defined in the ReadModes dictionary.


Parameters:

istream : an input stream 
[types] : an array with one or more of the following type specifiers: 
Number	- specifies a real number 
Double	- specifies a real number 
Integer- specifies an integer 
Word  	- a white space separated string 
String	- a text line terminated with a newline character


References:

ReadList approximates the Mathematica function.
