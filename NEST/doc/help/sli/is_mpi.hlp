Name: is_mpi - flag in statusdict indicating whether interpreter was compiled with MPI

Synopsis:

statusdict/is_mpi :: -> boolean


Description:

The C++ startup of a SLI interpreter which is not compiled with MPI support may 
be completely unaware of distributed computing and may therefore not define the /is_mpi 
flag. In order to simplify user code, processes.sli sets /is_mpi to false if it is 
not defined.
