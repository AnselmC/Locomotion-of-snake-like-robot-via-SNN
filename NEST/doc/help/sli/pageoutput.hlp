Name: pageoutput - Display the output of a procedure through "page".

Synopsis:

{procedure} pageoutput -> result_of_procedure


Examples:

{(This is my output.) =} pageoutput 
{MemoryInfo} pageoutput 
{whos} pageoutput 
{mydir info} pageoutput


Description:

"pageoutput" executes the procedure that is passed as an argument. It 
captures any printed output that the procedure generates and 
displays it via the "page" command (see documentation of "page"). 
"pageoutput" redirects SLI's standard output at the level of the 
file descriptor. This is a very low-level operation, and captures 
*all* output that the SLI process sends to stdout. This includes any 
output from SLI commands, from the simulation kernel, and all error 
messages that go to stdout. 
If the procedure raises an error, the error message is included in 
the paged output, and the file descriptors are restored, so that 
subsequent output goes to the SLI prompt again.


Bugs:

"pageoutput" creates a temporary file that is passed to the "page" 
command. The pager may be executed in a subprocess of SLI. Since we 
do not know how long it takes the pager process to open the file, we 
cannot delete it right after calling "page". Hence, the temporary 
file remains forever. Currently it is unclear how the temporary file 
can be removed at a later time. This bug is filed as ticket #262.


Diagnostics:

Any error messages that the procedure raises go to the paged output. 
In case of errors, the file descriptors are correctly restored.
