Name: testsuite::ticket-336-mpi - Check that vp-specific RNGs generate proper random numbers

Synopsis:

(ticket-336-mpi) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test ensures that GetVpRNG, when called on a node with proxies, generates 
the same random number is generated independent of the number of MPI 
processes.


Remarks:

In response to the changes of GetStatus return values (cf #549), 
this test now only checks that the first 10 RNs from its VP-RNG are 
identical independent of the number of MPI processes.
