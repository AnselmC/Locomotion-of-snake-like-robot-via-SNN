Name: EvaluateLiteralInfixes - Evaluates an array of infix expressions

Synopsis:

array -> array


Examples:

[ 5 /add 6 /sub 2] EvaluateLiteralInfixes --> [9] 
[ 5 --> 6 true ] EvaluateLiteralInfixes   --> [false true]


Description:

The function evaluates an array of expressions assuming that every 
literal is an infix operator. Inside this function --> is defined as 
eq, the comparison for equality.


Remarks:

With the further development of test driven programming and unit 
testing in NEST, the function may develop into a more complete 
parser for infix notation
