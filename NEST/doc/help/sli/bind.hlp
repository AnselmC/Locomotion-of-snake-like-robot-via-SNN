Name: bind - recursively replaces executable operator names by their values.

Synopsis:

proc bind --> proc


Examples:

{1 2 add} bind --> {1 2 +add+} 
if you know the arguments are integer, 
{1 2 add_ii} will be the fastest choice, but there will be no 
sli-level typechecking any more!


Description:

bind iterates through the given procedure object and replaces names which are bound to 
tries or functions by their values. 
bind works recursively and processes any nested procedure object it encounters. 
bind uses the current dictionary context to perform its operation. Thus, changing 
the dictionary context after bound was applied has no effect on the name-lookup 
of operators during the execution of the procedure. 
bind removes some execution overhead which is due to name-lookup. Thus, a bound procedure 
executes 10%-50% faster.


Parameters:

proc	- procedure to be bound
