Name: testsuite::fail_distributed_pass_or_die - self test of distributed_pass_or_die

Synopsis:

nest_indirect distributed_pass_or_die.sli ->	-


Description:

This is a self test of distributed_pass_or_die. The function needs to 
be able to collect the results of an arbitrary number of jobs and 
checks whether all jobs return true for all runs; this will only be the 
case if the code for all jobs completes and leaves the stack empty.
