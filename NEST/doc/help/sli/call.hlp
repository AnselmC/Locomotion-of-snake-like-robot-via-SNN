Name: call - Execute object from a dictionary.

Synopsis:

dict /f call ->	-


Description:

In SLI, an object-oriented programming style can be 
implemented by using dictionaries as objects. 
These object dictionaries then contain functions as well as data. 
The command call can be used to call a "member" of an object. 
In calling the member-functions, the following steps are performed: 
1. the object-dictionary is pushed on the dictionary stack 
2. the name is executed in the new dictionary context 
3. the object-dictionary is poped off the dictionary stack. 
Thus, during the execution of the function, the entire namespace of the 
object-dictionary is accessible. 
The invocation of call is, thus, comparable but not equivalent 
to the following sequence of SLI commands: 
/call 
{ 
exch 
begin 
load exec 
end 
} def


Diagnostics:

If the called member is not part of the object dictionary, 
an UnknownMember error is raised.
