Name: testsuite::test_wfr_settings - Tests the possible settings for the waveform relaxation method

Synopsis:

(test_wfr_settings) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

The waveform relaxation method is used for iterative solution when connections 
without delay are present (e.g. gap junctions) 
This test ensures that 
	- use_wfr can only be set before nodes are created 
	- wfr_comm_interval can only be set greater or equal the resolution and if use_wfr = true 
	- setting of use_wfr = false sets wfr_comm_interval to resolution 
	- wfr_comm_interval is updated when resolution is changed and use_wfr = false 
	- use_wfr is set correctly in created nodes
