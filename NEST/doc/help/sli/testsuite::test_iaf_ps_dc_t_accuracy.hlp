Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ps_dc_t_accuracy - test of temporal accuracy of iaf_neuron subject to DC current

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_ps_dc_t_accuracy) run ->  comparison with analytical solution


Description:

A DC current is injected for a finite duration. The time of the first 
spike is compared to the theoretical value for different computation 
step sizes and interpolation orders. 
Computation step sizes are specified as base 2 values. 
The high accuracy of the neuron models is achieved by the use of 
Exact Integration [1] and an appropriate arrangement of the terms 
[2]. For small computation step sizes the accuracy at large 
simulation time decreases because of the accumulation of errors. 
The expected output is documented at the end of the script. 
Individual simulation results can be inspected by uncommented the 
call to function print_details.


Remarks:

The script checks whether the simulator is appropriately configured. 
The script can be used to check whether the accuracy has survived optimization. 
In case the accuracy is higher than specified by IEEE arithmetics this might 
be due to the use of processor registers. The compiler option 
-ffloat-store of the gcc compiler ensures that doubles are not stored in 
registers.
