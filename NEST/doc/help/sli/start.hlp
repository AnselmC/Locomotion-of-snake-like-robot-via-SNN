Name: start - interpreter start symbol

Synopsis:

- start ->	-


Examples:




Description:

The full featured life of the interpreter begins after 
boot-strapping with sli-init.sli by pushing the start symbol. 
When no commandline arguments are present the start symbol 
prepares for an interactive session in the shell with the 
help of the executive command. When command line arguments 
are present a non-interactive session is assumed and the start 
symbol prepares for recognition of these 
arguments with the help of the :commandline command. 
When executing files and an error is raised that is not 
caught by the script, quit with the exit code scripterror, which 
is defined in the exitcodes dictionary in statusdict.


Parameters:

start does not take any arguments. It evaluates the length 
of argv which resides in the statusdict.
