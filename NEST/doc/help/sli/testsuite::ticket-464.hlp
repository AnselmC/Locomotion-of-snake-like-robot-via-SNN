Name: testsuite::ticket-464 - Ensure that UniversalDataLogger triggers assertion with frozen multimeter.

Synopsis:

(ticket-464) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Ensure that NEST triggers an assertion in UniversalDataLogger::record_data() instead of seg faulting 
when a frozen multimeter is connected to a node.


Remarks:

This test has been modified (2011-02-11) to reflect the fact that NEST now protects 
multimeter against being frozen. Thus, the first test triggers an error instead of 
and assertion, and crash_or_die has been replaced by fail_or_die. 
This test will only be executed if NEST has been compiled without MPI support.
