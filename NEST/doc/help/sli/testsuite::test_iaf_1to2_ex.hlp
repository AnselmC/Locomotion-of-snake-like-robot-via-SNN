Name: testsuite::test_iaf_1to2_ex - sli script for test of min_delay

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_1to2_ex) run -> compare with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_1to2_ex checks the invariance of the spike interaction of 
two iaf_neuron model neurons with respect to the min_delay of the 
kernel. 
In order to obtain identical results for different computation step 
sizes h, the SLI script needs to be independent of h.  This is 
achieved by specifying all time parameters in milliseconds (ms). In 
particular the time of spike emission and the synaptic delay need to 
be integer multiples of the computation step sizes to be 
tested. test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay demonstrates the strategy for the 
case of DC current input. 
A DC current in the pre-synaptic neuron is adjusted to cause a spike 
at a grid position (t=3.0 ms) joined by all computation step sizes to 
be tested. 
Note that in a neuron model where synaptic events are modeled by a 
truncated exponential the effect of the incoming spike would be 
visible at the time of impact (here, t=5.0 ms). This is because the 
initial condition for the post-synaptic potential (PSP) has a 
non-zero voltage component. For PSPs with finite rise time the 
situation is different. In this case the voltage component of the 
initial condition is zero (see documentation of 
test_iaf_psp). Therefore, at the time of impact the PSP is only 
visible in other components of the state vector. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script. 
The simulation is run with several values of min_delay, which all 
should yield identical results.
