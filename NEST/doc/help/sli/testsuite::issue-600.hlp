Name: testsuite::issue-600 - Checks that waveform relaxation works with MPI

Synopsis:

(issue-600) run ->	-


Description:

issue-600.sli ensures that the iterative solution scheme in NEST still works when 
neurons that use waveform relaxation are only present on a subset of all available 
MPI processes. The test is a slightly changed version of test_gap_junctions_mpi.sli.
