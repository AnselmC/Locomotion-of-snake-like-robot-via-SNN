Name: sub - subtract two numbers or vectors

Synopsis:

n1 n2  sub -> n3 
a1 a2  sub -> a3


Examples:

5 2   sub -> 3 
5.0 2 sub -> 3.0 
[5 7] [3 4] sub -> [2 3] 
[3 4] 1 sub -> [2 3]


Description:

sub can be used to subtract numbers and arrays. 
If applied to numbers, sub returns the difference of the numbers. If one 
of the arguments is a double, the result is also a double. 
Applied to arrays, sub perfoms a per-component subtraction of the two 
arrays. The components must be numbers, however, integer and double 
values may be mixed. 
Note that the two arrays must be of the same size.
