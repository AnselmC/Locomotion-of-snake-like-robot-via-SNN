Name: testsuite::ticket-787 - Ensure that all commands raise errors instead of crashing

Synopsis:

(ticket-787) run -> NEST fails if test fails


Description:

This ticket executes all tries, procedures and functions in systemdict. 
Candidates with names beginning with :, ending with _ or explicitly 
excluded are not tested, since they are internals that need not implement 
complete error checking. 
As long as they all either pass or raise proper errors, the test will pass. 
Remark: 
	- This test will only run in serial mode, as it needs to spawn subprocesses. 
	- Functions defined in other dictionaries that systemdict are not tested.
