Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse - sli script for the multisynapse model

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse) run


Description:

This test creates a multisynapse neuron and first checks if time constants 
can be set correctly. Afterwards, it simulates with four different time constants 
and records the neuron's synaptic current. The expected PSC-maxima are 
calculated and compared with the simulated currents.
