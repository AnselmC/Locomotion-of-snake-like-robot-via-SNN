Name: LambertW - simple iteration implementing the Lambert-W function

Synopsis:

double double LambertW -> double


Description:

The Lambert-W function is the inverse function of x=W*exp(W). For real values of 
x and W, the function W(x) is defined on [-1/e,\infty). On the interval [-1/e,0) 
it is double valued. The two branches coincide at W(-1/e)=-1. The so called 
principal branch LambertW0 continuously grows (W>=-1) and crosses the origin (0,0). 
The non-principal branch LambertWm1 is defined on [-1/e,0) and declines to -\infty for 
growing x. 
LambertW uses Halley's method described in [1] (see also [2]) to 
implement the functions for the two branches LambertW0 and LambertWm1 
if NEST has no access to the GSL [3]. 
Version: 090818


Parameters:

The first parameter is the argument of the Lambert-W function, the 
second argument is the start value of the iteration. 0.0 is a good initial 
value for the principal branch of the Lambert-W function. -2.0 is a good 
choice to select the non-principal branch.
