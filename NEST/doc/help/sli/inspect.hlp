Name: inspect - inspect an object

Synopsis:

any inspect ->	- 
any  ?	 ->	-


Examples:

/stack inspect 
/stack : proceduretype := 
{ 
0i 
1i 
-count- 
3i 
-sub_ii- 
{ 
-index- 
= 
} 
-for- 
} 
SLI ] [10] Range inspect 
[ 1i 2i 3i 4i 5i   ...  ] 
SLI ] [1. 10.] Range inspect 
[ 1d 2d 3d 4d 5d   ...  ]


Description:

inspect (or ?) displays the contents of an object in a formatted form. 
SLI procedures are displayed with indentation according to their 
nesting level. The amount of indentation is controlled by the 
value of :INDENTATION, which is defined in debugdir. 
The most common usage is to apply inspect to a literal. Inspect 
resolves the name in the current dictionary context and gives 
a formatted output of the contents. 
Numeric values are displayed with the letters (d) or (i) to indicate 
the type of the numeral. 
The display of arrays is truncated, if they are longer than the 
value of :ARRAYLIMIT. the remaining entries are replaced by 
an elipsis ( ... ).


Bugs:

The displays of TypeTrees and Procedures could be more elaborated. 
Maybe the next version will show the individual parameter-lists of 
a TypeTree.


Remarks:

? can be used as shortcut to inspect
