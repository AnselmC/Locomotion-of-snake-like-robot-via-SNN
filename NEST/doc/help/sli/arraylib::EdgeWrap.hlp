Name: arraylib::EdgeWrap - Wrap 2-d array indices around edges (toriodal)

Synopsis:

[2d-indices] height width EdgeWrap -> [wrapped-2d-indices]


Description:

This function iterates through the given array indices and checks if 
they lie inside the specified range [0,height) and [0,width), 
respectively. 
Indices are modified according to the following rules: 
1. If both indices lie inside [0,height) and [0,width), respectively, 
they are left untouched. 
2. If the row   index lies outside [0,height) it is cyclicly wrapped 
around. That is, a suitable multiple of "height" is added or 
substracted, that makes the index fall inside [0,height). 
3. If the column index lies outside [0,width) it is cyclicly wrapped 
around. That is, a suitable multiple of "width" is added or 
substracted, that makes the index fall inside [0,width). 
Thus, the indices are effectively wrapped around the array edges; 
that is, they are mapped onto a torus of dimensions height,width. 
Note that by NEST convention, for index pairs, the first index denotes 
the row, and the second index denotes the column. 
Dimensions of the index array are preserved.


Diagnostics:

The index array is expected to be a (nested) array of integer values 
only. Code will break otherwise.


Remarks:

The index array is expected to be a (nested) array of integer values only.
