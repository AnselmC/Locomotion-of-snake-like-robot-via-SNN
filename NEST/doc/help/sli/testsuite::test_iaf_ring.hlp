Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ring - sli script for test of iaf_neuron spike interaction 
 across multiple machines.

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_iaf_ring  --> success


Description:

test_iaf_ring checks if spikes can travel along a chain of neurons 
and whether the result is independent of the number of machines 
involved in the computation. 
The unittest function distributed_assert_or_die can only handle the 
output of a single machine. Therefore the script collects the spikes 
of all neurons using a parrot neuron. The script does not check the 
id of the sender, only the spike timing. A more strict test could be 
carried out with a unittest function which merges the output of all 
machines. 
The correct sequence of spikes including their ids is documented at 
the end of this file. Note that due to the use of an intermediate 
parrot neuron the reported spike times have an offset of 1ms (10 
steps) with respect to the documented values. The offset corresponds 
to the default delay of 1ms.
