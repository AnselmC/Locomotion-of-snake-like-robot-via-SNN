Name: oldgetline - "old", ignorant version of getline

Synopsis:

istream getline -> istream string


Description:

Reads a string from the supplied stream. If an error occured 
during the read process, an empty string is returned. 
This function is for compatibility. Eventually, all 
occurences of oldgetline should convert to the new, 
more save version of getline.

NO ERRORS are raised!
