Name: regex_find_sf - Check if a regex is included in a stream

Synopsis:

string istream -> boolean


Examples:

See examples of regex_find, exchange second string with a file.


Description:

Takes the first argument. Converts to regex 
and calls regexec to find out if this regex matches the 
stream. Reports success/failure in a boolean true/false.


Parameters:

in: first argument  : a string which will be converted 
to a regex by a regcomp call. 
second argument : an istream where this 
regex should be matched. 
out: true/false telling if there is/is no match.


Bugs:

-


Diagnostics:

Will raise an /InvalidRegexError if regcomp cannot 
compile the regex. Try immidiate 
:regerror = to find out why!


Remarks:

Does _not_ return any information about the matched 
expression more than matched/not matched; use lower 
level commands regcomp, regexec if in need!
