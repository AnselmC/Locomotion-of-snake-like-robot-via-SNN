Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psp - sli script for test of iaf_neuron spike input

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_psp) run -> compare response with reference data


Description:

test_iaf_psp.sli checks the voltage response of the iaf_neuron 
model neuron to a single incoming spike. The voltage excursion is 
called post-synaptic potential (PSP). In the iaf_neuron model neuron 
the post-synaptic current is described by an alpha-function 
(see [1] and references therein). The resulting PSP has a finite 
rise-time, with voltage and current beeing zero in the initial 
condition (see [1]). 
The dynamics is tested by connecting a device that emits spikes 
at individually configurable times (see test_spike_generator) to 
a model neuron. 
The weight of the connection specifies the peak value (amplitude) 
of the post-synaptic current (PSC) in pA. 
The subthreshold dynamics of the iaf_neuron is integrated exactly. 
Therefore, it is suitable to check whether the simulation kernel 
produces results independent of the computation step size 
(resolution). 
In order to obtain identical results for different computation 
step sizes h, the SLI script needs to be independent of h. 
This is achieved by specifying all time parameters in milliseconds 
(ms). In particular the time of spike emission and the synaptic 
delay need to be integer multiples of the computation step sizes 
to be tested. test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay demonstrates the strategy 
for the case of DC current input. 
The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
the script.
