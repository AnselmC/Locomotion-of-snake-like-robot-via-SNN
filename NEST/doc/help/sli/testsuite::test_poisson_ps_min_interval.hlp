Name: testsuite::test_poisson_ps_min_interval - checks that intervals are independent of tic size

Synopsis:

(test_poisson_ps_min_interval) run -> minimum interal close to 0


Description:

The inter spike interval (ISI) distribution of a Poisson process is 
exponential. The test verifies that the minimum interval is arbitrarily 
small and not constrained by the ms_per_tic property of the simlation kernel.


Remarks:

Even a correct implementation generates with low probability spike trains where the 
minimal interval is larger than ms_per_tic. The seed set in the default configuration 
of NEST avoids this problem. Therefore, failure of this script indicates that the 
configuration is not portable.
