none


Description:

This dictionary contains the global option for 
certain functions. Within the dictionary each 
function name is associated with a dictionary 
which contains the options for that function. 
Note that the accessibility, i.e. the dicitonary 
in which a function is defined is not accounted for. 
It is suggested that you use a C++-like notation to indicate the 
availability of the function, if the function is defined in some 
"namespace" dictionary. 
For example: "arr::Mean".
