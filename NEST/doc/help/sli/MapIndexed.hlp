Name: MapIndexed - Apply a function  to each element of a list/string

Synopsis:

[v1 ... vn] {f} MapIndexed -> [ f(v1,1) ... f(vn,n) ]


Examples:

[1 2 3 4 5]  {add} MapIndexed -> [2 4 6 8 10] 
(abcd) {add} MapIndexed -> (bdfh)


Description:

For each element of the input array, MapIndexed calls f with 
two arguments, the current index and the element. It replaces 
the element with the result of f. 
MapIndexed works similar to Map, however, in adition to the 
element its index within the array is also passed to the function. 
Note that the index starts with 1, according to Mathematica convention. 
This is unlike in forallindexed where in accordance with Postscript 
array indices start with 0. 
The result of MapIndexed is a list with the same number of values as the 
argument list. 
If f does not return a value, MapIndexed fails. 
If f returns more than one value, the result of MapIndexed is 
undefined. 
Alternatives: Function MapIndexed_a for lists and  MapIndexed_s 
for strings (both undocumented) -> behaviour and synopsis are 
the same.


Parameters:

[v1 ... vn]	- list of n arbitrary objects or string. 
{f}		- function of two arguments and one return value.
