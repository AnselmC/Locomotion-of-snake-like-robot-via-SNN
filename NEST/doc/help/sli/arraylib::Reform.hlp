Name: arraylib::Reform - Reform the dimensions of a hyperrectengular array

Synopsis:

[array] [dim1 dim2 ... dimn] Reform -> [reformedArray]


Description:

"Reform" changes the dimensionality i.e. the nesting of an array. The 
result is a hyperrectangular array of the given dimensions. The order 
of elements is not changed. 
"Reform" relates to "Dimensions" in the following way: 
Given a hyperrectangular array [a] of "Dimensions" [d], these 
statements are true: 
a	 d Reform -> a 
a Flatten   d Reform -> a 
a dv Reform d Reform -> a, for any valid dimension vector [dv]


Diagnostics:

If the new dimensionality is not consistent with the numer of elements 
in the array, /RangeCheck is raised.


Remarks:

The new dimensionality must not change the number of elements in the 
whole array, that is, dim1*...*dimn must equal the number of the 
flattened source array.


Availability:

"Namespace"-dictionary "arraylib".


References:

This routine is inspired by IDL's REFORM() routine.
