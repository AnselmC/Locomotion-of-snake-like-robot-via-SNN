Name: Dimensions - determine dimenstions of a (hyper-rectangular) SLI array

Synopsis:

[array] Dimensions -> [d1 d2 ... dn]


Examples:

SLI ] [1 2 3]	 Dimensions -> [3] 
SLI ] [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]	 Dimensions -> [2 3] 
SLI ] [[[1 2][3 4]][[5 6][7 8]]] Dimensions -> [2 2 2]


Description:

Dimensions corresponds to the Mathematica function of 
the same name. It takes a sli array and returns a list with 
dimensions [d1 d2 ... dn] where di gives the dimension of the 
array at level i. 
The length of the dimensions-list corresponds to the TensorRank of 
the array.


Remarks:

Dimensions assumes that the array is hyper-rectangular 
(rectangle,cuboid, ...), i.e., all subarrays at a given level 
have the same number of elements. 
Dimensions does not check, if the array really is hyper-rectangular. It 
will not fail if this is not the case. Instead, the dimensions 
that are returned correspond to the number of elements of the 
first subarray in each level.
