Name: searchfile - tries to open a file for reading using one of 
 the pathes given within an array of pathnames.

Synopsis:

(filename) [pathnames] searchfile -> istream true 
-> false


Examples:

test.dat [(./) ( /) (/home/synod/)] tries to open test.dat for 
reading using the current, your user, and the /home/synod/ path one 
after the other. It opens the first test.dat found along the way, 
or returns false if there is no one in neither path.


Description:

searchfile concatenates every pathname with the filename and 
calls ifstream until ifstream was able to open the file or until no 
other path is left. In ordinary cases you will not call searchfile, 
but searchifstream. Call searchfile if you want to use customized 
search pathes.


Parameters:

string is the filename, while array contains pathname strings.


Bugs:




Diagnostics:

The routine issues debugging messages of priority M_DEBUG 
displaying the search status.
